            "Angeleea waited on us and she was AMAZING.My friend and I were here on December 17, 2017 and we experienced the BEST SERVICE in Sydney. Over the top service. Our lovely waitress not only gave us excellent food recommendations, but she even showed me a map of where we needed to walk to find some fresh flowers for the crematorium. We are just tourists and have no clue where to go, and it was so nice to have a helpful person.   NOW...THE FOOD. Oven baked scallops with clam meat, garlic butter and flatbread. Holy cow! Delish, and just the right amount. Loved the presentation in the pretty white shells.  Next we tried the fried squid with squid ink aioli. Again another great little meal. Very crisp and tasty.  Hot. Cheese. Dip. YESSSSS!!!! This is the one thing on the menu that we saw on their website that made us want to come here in the first place. A hot sizzling iron plate of gooey white cheese, served with warm toasty flatbread. YUM.  Elegant atmosphere and a great view of Darling Harbour. Very impressive place.",
            "I came here for dinner while looking at dozens of possibilities in the area. Everything tasted awesome. It was a little pricey. If you're looking for a place to eat at, stop by...Im kinda picky and you wouldn't be disappointed"

You cannot go wrong with this choice. For my main fare I enjoyed the Crispy Chicken. Another excellent meal all-around. The decor here also stuns. They even turned a lift/elevator shaft into a wine cellar. I guarantee if you visit, you will love it. Come here with friends, or come here alone, either way a smashing good time indeed.",

With the USD exchange rate the way it is, the meal here was a steal! Less than $20 USD/person for Peking Duck, Beef, Pork, and rice. I only wish I were able to try the seafood, but alas, some in my party were seafood adverse. I would love to come back one day!!!"

It was interesting to find a ribs & burger spot amongst some of the international influences and craft breweries and wineries, but I'm glad I happened upon this comfort food spot and had the best lamb burger I've ever had. The lamb was juicy and well seasoned, balanced by the greens and feta cheese, and the fluffy bun made it a great experience. The fries were a little average, but the service when it came out was fast and the servers were nice, and the relaxed ambiance made it an enjoyable lunch!",

The restaurant is clean, there were indoor & shady outside seating.  The lamb was lean, juicy, flavorful & it fell off the bones.  These were the best rack of lamb lamb I've ever had. Exceptional! I don't know what they did, how they made these,or what they rub them with, they were like nothing else.  We're in Australia and I needed to have lamb from the Barbie!",

Service: 4.5 / 5 stars Vibe: 5 / 5 stars Food: 4.5 / 5 stars  The views on the Sydney Harbour Bridge with open windows on the round tables were a must snag for our party of 5. You can even spectate the chefs cooking if you really want to through open glass. There are outside tables and I love the seats inside. There is something about the colour schemes of the restaurant that really mesh well with the vintage props for the display and comfortable seats!  Service was great with big smiles and being ushered in with a welcome. Although, loses a .5 score because sometimes it's questionable and service just tries to getaway with just doing it's job. But we felt mostly welcome coming in. Also, a great lunch / dinner spot for families as well as big parties are welcomed.  The ribs were flipping magic! So tender and melts in your mouth. The best ribs I've ever tasted and I hated ribs. The peri chicken burger was great but just does it's job. Perhaps caramlise the onions so there is more flavour. The Loaded Burger was the main stair and the flipping awesome chips! This place sells one of the best chips!  I'd recommend getting the Loaded Burger with chips at a first go."

It was on the heavy side for a lunch dish, but I would eat that every day if I could; it was that good.   The server, who was also originally from the United States, was helpful in selecting a cocktail that I enjoyed too, though I forget the name. It was a sweeter, gin-based drink.

Underneath was the best artichoke I have ever eaten.  It was moist as if steamed, yet grilled on the barbie. It had little bitterness and added a dimension I would never have put together.

            "Epic Roti here!  Their regular roti was beautifully executed.  You can watch the roti chef roll out the dough and make it at the window.   It was crispy and nicely &quot;poofed&quot;.   The dessert Roti was superrrrrr crispy and fun to eat.  It was so thin and crispy.  I'm curious as to how it's made and formed into the cone!    Fried chicken:  this one was nicely seasoned, juicy inside, crispy outside, sugary on the under side. One of my top ranked fried chickens.  Very delish! Hefty price for 1 piece though - $6!   Chicken curry: curry was flavorful.    Roti with egg: good but not crispy, flaky like the plain Roti.   Service was ok. Our foreign credit card didn't work online so had to get up, go to the counter to order.    Restaurant was nice and clean.",

            "We were warmly greeted and our waitress gave off good vibes!   The scallop crudo was sweet and the finger lime and ponzu added some sour and salt. We were recommended the flounder special by our waitress. The fish was fresh and seasoned perfectly. You could still taste the flavor of the fish without the seasoning overpowering it.   It was still early in the day so we ordered mock tails. The yellow drink is the passionate orange. It contains, orange Juice, passion fruit, lemon, and coconut water. The red drink is called Mr. George. It has, guava nectar, pineapple juice, lemons, berries, and hibiscus syrup. Both were delicious but personally I preferred the passionate orange. It was sweet but also sour.   Lastly, we order the pavlova. I wasn't expecting much, but when it was served, I was blown away by the presentation. The pavlova was served on a bed of dry ice that smoked out and over our table. It was tasty and a joy to look at!",

            "With Vivid Sydney 2019 fast approaching, it is an exciting time of the year to be in Sydney. This gave us great pleasure to be a part of the launch of the Four Seasons Hotel Chroma Dinner Premiere.  The Four Seasons are getting into the Vivid festive spirit by providing a unique culinary experience at their Mode Kitchen & Bar. The Chroma dinner includes a four course meal, with each dish designed to awaken the senses, and to take you on a culinary journey of colour, scent, sound and light. Inspired by the colours red, blue, green, they have been created to enhance the dining experience.  As guests enter a newly created white room, you are suddenly transformed into a world of colour and a sensorial awakening. Prior to arriving to this dinner, the evening for us started in the Presidential Suite of the Four Seasons Hotel, and we were greeted with three rooms illuminated with the colours red, blue and green. The highlight room was the blue room with the spa bath filled with bottles of champagne, and glasses surrounding the rim of the tub, and overlooking the iconic Sydney Opera House. A stunning hotel room with 360 degrees of the city, and we got to enjoy the room all whilst sipping wine and tasting some canapes.  Following the walk around the Presidential suite, it was time for the dinner in the white room with the visual projections to enhance the food experience, by transporting guests into the middle of the jungle, under the reef or in a psychedelic world.  The first course 'fishing in the jungle' (green) included the Hiramasa Kingfish with Aboriginal green ants, herbs chlorophyll and stracciatella. This came with a cocktail 'green savannah jelly'  The second course, the 'reef promenade' (blue), was served a spanner crab risotto, purple cabbage and scampi caviar. Brilliantly blue! Served with the Toji Junmai Ginjo cocktail   The third course,  'The Devil's Bath' (red colour) included the ruby snapper with smoked strawberry gazpacho and radish. An absolutley delightful and beautifully presented dish, served with the 'strawberry fields' cocktail.  Dessert, and certainly a highlight was the 'sweet canvas' -  this was white chocolate, vanilla and mandarin sphere served with blueberry, raspberry and pistachio which looked literally, like materials to create a work of art on the place, served with the 'la vie' cocktail."

            "I was staying at the Star Casino and had the buffet breakfast.  Tons of Japanese cuisines and you're also able to order from a menu with the buffet.    Key winners from the buffet section was the juices (comes in a sale pourer), smoked salmon, and congi (Asian rice porridge).    Would I come back?  At least once every time I visit Sydney and staying at the star",
            "We had been hearing many good things for a long time about Sokyo at the Star, not only their Japanese dinner, but also their buffet breakfast. As we began 2018, we decided it was finally time to visit. Do make sure you book ahead of time as it can be hard to secure a spot.  In attendance were our insta foodie friends and contributor Sakinav and one of the best food bloggers in Sydney: Spooning Australia, as acclaimed by the Good Food Guide. We all met at Sokyo, a modern restaurant with floral displays, neatly set tables and an inviting buffet. The place very much had a hotel feel.    We are all seated, scoped out the offerings on display at the buffet and also perused the menu. We were in two minds regarding out choice for the menu and whether to get al a carte or buffet. $22.50 for a la carte or $28 for buffet. From the ala carte menu are a range of Japanese inspired dishes. However, you can also go for the $38 for an a la carte option, buffet, tea and coffee, that is the choice! What could be better?  All of us ordered something different from the al a carte menu. Whilst we wait for the ala carte dish, we start a conga line back and forth from the buffet, shuffling around like busy little worker ants. Everyone has a hand in arranging food at the table. You'd have think there was a small army eating, not just 5.  The coffee then arrived at the table, however, with so many good boutique coffees out there, it was a little bit of a let down that they were using a large commercial brand, but I guess it will appeal to the masses. Be mindful though, some of the drinks cost extra, like the matcha or turmeric lattes.  The buffet was quite simple with a range of cakes some with a hint of Japanese flavour including yuzu or matcha. All very nice and beautifully prepared. There was fruit and yogurt as well as an allotment of beautiful cheese and meat. In typical Asian buffet style, somethings that we always love like some soba noodles, with your choice of toppings. There was also the congee, a savoury rice pudding. With this pudding, were an array of savoury condiments to add flavour, be it fried challots, spring onion, soy sauce, ginger battons or pickled plum.  The buffet was nice but paled in comparison to the a la carte menu. When the food we ordered started to arrive at the table there was much food envy. The match lamington, very Japanese was nicely presented with a yuzu curd and red bean inside. It was extremely beautiful and overall a lovely dish, despite the cake being a little dense.  The Sokyo seafood bowl was not your typical Austalian breakfast. A bowl of rice topped with an assortment of fresh seafood and an onsen egg. It started out a little standard and improved ten fold once all mixed together and flavours combining them together.  The taditional choushoku breakfast was impressive a set including miso soup, rice, fish of the day, edamame, nori, Japanese pickle and onsen tomago.  The star of the day, at the Star on this occasion appeared to be the spicy salmon udon ordered by Spooning.  As a whole, the breakfast at Sokyo was very enjoyable. The price is reasonable and the service is very good. Combining the a la carte and buffet options together is thoroughly recommended.",
            "Have been to Sokyo 3 times, impressive Japanese cuisines. Great atmosphere, huge selection of Japanese food, nice menu, wonderful drink list.  However, with all those nice options on menu, my favorite always been the Spicy Ramen...my Japanese girlfriend said it is very authentic..."

They have an extensive menu, but the tacos sounded great, so I ordered two. These were exceptional. Not only were they LARGE, but the toppings were full of flavors and textures that accompanied the fresh and fried-perfectly piece of fish on each taco. They were so big that I probably only needed one, but I happily finished two.   Solid place and friendly service.",

At prime location in the Rocks with A class service, you can't beat that!   Why is it so cheap? you might ask. It is a hospitality training school run through Torrens University Australia, it offers courses ranging from diplomas to degree. This restaurant is their on the job work experience.   Remember it's a training school, don't be hard on the staff. That said, the staff were incredibly attentive and professional and eager to please. The manager was also an excellent teacher and we could hear her guiding the staff with her knowledge and experience on display.   The food can be described as Modern Australian. It's old school food, showing the techniques learnt in training school that term and plated with finesse.   We had the beetroot entree, so tasty and beautifully plated, and we also tried the spanned crab, just divine.  The Roasted Milly Hill lamb cutlets, rillets of lamb showing great care and precision and skill in its plating. It came with lamb shoulder, confit tomato, crispy cauliflower and jus. We had this with a side of roasted veggies.   The Herb and ricotta gnocchi was absolutely lovely and nicely flavoured with with oyster mushroom, Tuscan cabbage and garden peas.   After our meal, we were good to try a bit of dessert. The Dark Chocolate delice was nice and smooth, served with burnt white chocolate, a marshmallow whip and a peanut brittle with a bit of Turkish delight too. We loved the marshmallow addition to this dish.   Ranked 5th on trip advisor, we can see why! It is a high quality dining experience, marvellous food and served in an efficient manner. What a great initiative to give these staff vocational training whilst gaining support and development.",

All of the food we had was top notch, and the service was friendly and professional, even if there were a few details that weren't perfectly polished.  Perhaps because it is a training environment the prices are extremely reasonable, both for food and wine. There's no question that it's the best value of all of Sydney's fine dining restaurants.",

            "This was our favorite meal in Sydney.   It was also the most expensive.  We had the tomahawk MB 9+ steak.   Delicious and fatty as heck!  We did not get an outside table because we were walk-ins.  We sat upstairs and watched from the scenic window.  The only dish that missed the mark for us, was the miso cod.  So don't expect it to taste anything like it would in a Japanese restaurant.  Maybe it was overcooked because it did not flake off as usual.  But the rest were delicious:   calamari, steak tartare, scallops, and chicken.",

            "As a visitor from the states, you never know if waterside dining on the harbor is a tourist trap, or a classy dining experience. I'm here to say the latter of 6 Head. My husband was craving steak and I was craving a good meal with a great view. 6 Head delivered on all of the above.   To start, the atmosphere is a step above any other restaurant we visited in Sydney. The service was phenomenal and we were able to snag a table for two outside without a reservation.  The staff was friendly and attentive but not obnoxiously interruptive of our meal.   My husband ordered the Caesar salad and a steak, which was cooked perfectly. I ordered the burrata to start and  chicken as my main with a sort of corn mash: both were to DIE for!  I also ordered a glass of Rose from an Aussie winery in VIC which very nicely complimented the meal. I'll be looking for the wine back in the states, and hope to recreate the corn mash in my own kitchen as well   We highly recommend 6 Head to tourists and locals alike!"

Like next door, it is self service so order at the counter and make sure you pick up a black tray to collect your food on. Pick up any drinks you want before ordering your food as well. You can then select from their hot food station to add any extras if a bit more ravenous. Service is polite and efficient.  I went with Ontama Teriyaki Chicken Bowl, and Curry Croquette. You can choose between having a regular and large bowl as well. The chicken was tasty and had a nice flavour to it. Rice was well seasoned with the sauce.

We were staying at the Meriton Suites just off of Darling Harbor. So a quick trip across the bridge took us right to the restaurant. At first we got pulled in by the desserts. I was craving some solid sticky date pudding. Hubs accidentally ordered the sticky cookie instead. Not a bad mistake at all!!!    As we were enjoying our desserts, we read through the book of their menu (synonymous to Cheesecake Factory's), we realized we JAD to try some of their dishes. This began our 2 week relationship, lol. We went back over and over to try as much of the menu in each visit as we could finish (which was really only a 3 course meal shared between us).    The ribs and stuffed portabellos were where it was at, for sure. We enjoyed a specialty drink each visit, as well. The fairy floss, aka cotton candy, was divine.  I never thought I'd like cotton candy so much. It actually had strawberry flavor so that was fun! And way to represent Tam Tams in the form of a shake. YUM",

They sat me right away, also taking time to answer questions about the menu and make suggestions...  I never felt as though my questions were a bother or that I was being rushed to decide.  The food was reasonably priced, came out fast and tasted great.  I ordered the 300g sirloin with mashed potatoes and a cob of corn.  The steak was perfectly cooked (medium) and the corn on the cob was surprisingly tender - delicious!  I highly recommend this location (Darling Harbour/Harbourside Shopping Center)."

That being said, we were not there during peak hours. But the food would have been worth waiting for! I ordered a couple pieces of tuna sushi and the spicy Korean fried chicken.  I am incredibly picky when it comes to sushi, as raw fish can be tricky and sometimes feel rubbery - but the sushi here was so fresh and tender and flavorful.

Nice and crispy with a juicy meaty center. Flavors were spot on. Topped with shaved green apples and caramel. So good!  Wife got the miso chicken, which was nice and juicy.

From the raw section we had the kingfish ceviche and the Wagyu beef tartar. The Tartar was by far a better dish and so tasty!  For mains we had the Sake miso chicken with a side of the Japanese fried rice with pork and the Crispy Lotus chips. Holy moly the chicken is so tender and had a really lovely sweet burdock sauce!  To finish we had the Yukari infused pineapple sashimi, granita, liquorice parfait and the Milk chocolate jelly. The Yukari had such a refreshing finish.

In fact, the five-course tasting menu was superior to the tasting menu we had the previous night at the famous Quay restaurant around the bend.  Each dish was comprised of a perfect melding of ingredients and flavors, with the John Dory and the perfectly cooked lamb being particular standouts. The dessert--which was really three desserts on one plate-- was also outstanding.  The wine list is a bit limited, but there are some gems such as Tyrell's Vat 47 Chardonnay.  The only failing was the service, which although attentive missed a lot that you'd expect in this caliber of restaurant. Empty plates stayed on the table too long, and I think we must have requested our wine to be repoured at least a half dozen times. I wish restaurants would just leave the bottle at the table in the European style, as it would be better for both guest and server.

After taking a leisurely stroll along the harbour on Walsh Bay, my dining partner and I arrived at the steps of the Pier One hotel for lunch.  They say first impressions count, and I was wowed.  We were greeted with friendly, genuine smiles upon arriving at the steps to the hotel, from the bell boys outside, door staff, conceirge and reception.  The reception staff guided us to the restaurant.    The hotel and restaurant are new, shieke, and have a vibe of understated luxury.  The bathrooms even had a couch and a framed, wide floor to ceiling mirror!  The restaurant staff were just as friendly, and extremely attentive and polite.  We were sat right next to the harbour on a table on the outside section of the restaurant (on the wharf) straight away.    Our waitress was lovely.  No request was too much - from asking for a cocktail list when the bar was not open, to requesting the sun-shade to be raised up so that we could get a better view of the harbour.  The food and drinks were outstanding - especially the mains!  We had:  - Salmon gravlax and grapefruit entree - extremely fresh, clean taste.  I'm salivating thinking about this dish.  The novelty of the dish was that the grapefruit was the same colour as the salmon so you wouldn't know if you had a piece of fish or grapefruit until you eat it or inspect it closely.  - Scallops (one with coconut and lemongrass, one with ginger and soy sauce) - average.  - Grilled garlic butter prawns - average.  - Fish and chips main - the BEST fish and chips I've ever had, hands down.  My dining partner had the same thought.  The fish was very fresh, perfectly cooked, the batter was crispy and airy at the same time.  The chips were fat, a little bit like potato wedges, and were seasoned just the right amount.  The crisp on the chip was just right.  I'd given up all hopes in finding fish and chips I actually like - and to my surprise, I found it when I wasn't looking for it!  People say that certain beachside kiosks / cafes have the best fish and chips and I've been disappointed every time.  Now this truly is the best fish and chips I've ever had!!!  - Duck breast steak main - juicy, tender duck, and the vegetables, seasoning and sauce made the dish taste delicious.  - Sourdough bread with butter - good, but not amazing.  Unfortunately, we didn't leave enough room for dessert.    Prices are very reasonable considering the location, service, quality of food and ambience.   We were so impressed by the Gantry that my dining partner promised a return trip on the spot!    This is definitely somewhere I could go again and again.",
            "The service and food were excellent, as was the location. The agnolotti was out of this world. Surprisingly, the pumpkin spiced cake was absolutely delicious even though I am not a huge fan of pumpkin. All in all a great experience.   Even with all the above, the  restaurant  appears to be priced a bit on the high side.  We went for the Let's Do Lunch offer and shared one entree and one dessert between 2 people, didn't have any additional alcohol but the bill was still a hefty $70 per head (plus we were happy to give a tip because of the excellent service).   I would definitely go back there."

We had two appetizers (Australian word is 'entrees') and two mains. The beef pancake rolls were perfectly seasoned and delicious. Chicken wontons were also yum with a not-too spicy sauce. The mapo tofu was not too oily and had a sweet-ish spicy sauce. It was the perfect  amount for three people.   Prices were remarkably reasonable, servers friendly and attentive. We would gladly return. They even have an outdoor patio for alfresco dining when the weather behaves.",

This place is truly a hidden gem and I don't want to give it a good review in case it Becomes too popular and we can't get back in but they deserve the praise. We had the 6 entrees and 4 mains banquet. We picked half the dishes and left it up to the waitress to pick the rest. Good decision, her selections were better than ours, especially the beef in pancakes, yum yum. When we were leaving the manager personally asked us how we enjoyed the food and thanked us for coming. It may not have the harbour view but the food was amazing",

My favourites were the salt and pepper soft shell crab, sliced pork belly, basa fillets, stuffed tofu with mince, steamed snapper and the rib eye.  Muriel was a great host and we all enjoyed the food immensely and wondered why it took us so long to visit this place."

            "The best meal we had in sydney!! We did the $65 menu based on the other reviews saying the $80 one was so much food. The $65 was perfect. We were full but not so full.   We loved every single course - olives were unique and different sizes and flavors. The bread and hummus was great. My husband loved the hummus because it had a smoke flavor to it. One of my favorites was the polenta and cabbage mousse- so rich and slightly sweet. The cold cuts were fresh and amazing- my favorite was the salami. Great strong flavor! The chorizo with white beans was different but yummy and the perfect amount since it was quite rich. The chef meat selection was so great.. the crisp on the pork was delicious. It was cooked perfectly and the sauce with it was light and complimented the flavor nicely. Lastly, the dessert was one of the best I have ever had- the chocolate with the raspberry and pistachio was the perfect combination. I could eat it every day!   Service was good and helpful with our wine selections, brought me a taster so I could be sure to decide on the right one.   The restaurant is hidden in an alley so might be hard to find. They were also closed on Anzac Day so we missed dining with them on the first night we tried, so just know they may be closed on all holidays.   For the price and amount of food, I think it was one of the best deals we had and like I said, best tasting of anything we had so a great choice! Don't miss dining here!",
            "I made a reservation for Saturday night dinner at Mercado over a week in advance. It turned out to be a great choice - the restaurant was only a 3 minute walk from our hotel and adjacent to the club we wanted to go to that evening.  There were many tapas options on the a la carte menu and also two set menus to choose from (A$65 and A$80). My eyes were hungrier than my stomach and we ended up going up with the A$80 menu. My tip would be to go with the A$65 menu instead. In terms of quantity, we really did not need the Roasted Prawns, extra veggie side with the meat, and a second dessert.  Everything from start to finish was delicious. I like that Mercado groups dishes to serve several at a time. The Fish 'n Chips is a fish based dip served with potato chips, which is of course, total different than what I expected. The Jersey Milk Ricotta appetizers served with Truffle Honey was divine. This is the one item not on the A$65 menu that I would've really missed. The Truffle Mortadella was expertly made and the slices were beautiful.  The next set were larger &quot;appetizers&quot; including the famous Pumpkin Ravioli (as excellent as everyone claims), BBQ Chorizo (I was already starting to feel full at this point), and the Roasted Prawns (perhaps one of the weakest dishes of the evening).  At this point, our meat course came out. You can choose anything in the meat portion of the regular menu and we chose Spit Roasted Wagyu Beef Short Rib. It was a bit on the fatty side but fat is flavor and I really liked it. The spices and texture of the Roasted Carrots paired well with the short rib.  We were so stuffed but we're not quitters and still had two desserts to go. Both desserts were on the rich side. The Bread Pudding was beautifully presented in a small cast iron skillet and a vanilla sauce was poured on at the table. This is one of the best bread puddings I've ever had. The other dessert was Dulce De Leche Ice Cream with butterscotch. The dinner lasted two hours and we were one of the last tables still dining at the end of the evening. The food was really spectacular!",
            "Fan frigging tactic.   Threw caution to the wind and let the chef send a selection of dishes our way. In short, each was on point with some creative touches here and there.   The Turkish Ravioli with wood fired pumpkin was a standout, and I appreciated that I could actually taste the pumpkin.   The Brussels sprouts were delightful, with great smokey notes.   And the pork bellies. Amazing. Crispy skin with melt-in-your mouth smoothness just beneath. Their house pepper hot sauce added some nice heat if you're looking for some heat.   And dessert. The rosewater trifle was surprisingly good -- something I would not have selected on my own. But the rose tastes were subtle (no soap-sucking taste) and the pastry layers flaky.  My favourite was the dulce de leche ice cream with maple bacon &quot;candle&quot; and warm butterscotch sauce. Salty sweet goodness that harkened back to the chef's other passion -- the Good Times ice cream shop down the road."

In an area with a number of Japanese restaurants, you have to do something special to make people come back, and this Masuya has nailed it.   I decided on the mixed sashimi don along with a serving of the teriyaki salmon to share. The salmon was delicious if a little sickly with the thick sauce, but the freshness of the sashimi helped compliment this, combining into one fine meal!   The service was prompt but not rushed which I always appreciate if I'm not settling in for a marathon meal. I'm all for trying different places, but this place will definitely be getting a visit from me again. Lucky them!",

            "Have you ever wanted to try South American street food but have been a bit reluctant to travel by plane the +50 hours to get to the heart of South America? Now you don't have to thanks to Arepa, the ultimate restaurant for South American street food.  This cozy little place isn't much to look at on the inside. It keeps things simple and minimalist. Posters stuck up with black tape, neon logo sign, black and white menu board. The dining areas are one large wooden table to share inside and three small tables outside.  The menu is simple. Four different mains to choose from, each a corn dough pouch filled with wholesome and flavourful fillings. There is a vegetarian option, vegan option, chicken option and  pork option, with four chooses for extra fillings. Four dollars extra will give you a generous side of fries. Easy, tasty, satisfying.  Each table has its own napkin dispenser and bottle of chilli mayo and garlic aioli. Having the two greatest dipping sauces within arms reach truly defines heaven. We only made one of our corn pockets a combo, as one side of fries was enough for me and the wife. Was there an all out sauce war between the chilli mayo and garlic aioli? You bet.  The chips were cooked right on point. A delightful crunch outside with hot fluffy... cassava! Not potato but cassava, which looks like white sweet potato but tastes and feels just like potato. I honestly thought it was potato chips but no... cassava.  Our corn pockets came out in good time. They might look like something you'd have as a snack but believe me these hand held corn pockets will fill you up. My black beans and feta with guasacaca (mushy avocado) was amazing. The corn pocket held the filling firmly in place. The sharpness of the feta was subdued by the smoothness of the black beens. An absolute perfect balance of flavours.  This place also offers a selection of canned beers and cider. I'm not much of a tinnies fan myself but at the end of the day beer is beer, be it in a bottle or a bucket. Got to try my first watermelon pilsner. It's just what you'd expect, beer with an undercutting watermelon flavour. I had no idea it could be done. Not sure I'd order it again but it was well worth the try.  $42.50 for two corn pockets, one being a combo and two beers. At first I thought it was a bit steep but realised that the beers were $7 each. Would we come back? Try and stop us.",

I mean, C'mon. Gorgeous harbor view of the Sydney Opera House, the bridge, all of it. It will cost you the equivalent of a month's food budget, but it is definitely worth it.",
            "How ironic. Our day was spent hiking all around the harbour, and this evening we reserved a window view of all the places where we stopped to catch our breath. Ha! The panoramic view from our table was awesome -- God couldn't have made a better view if He tried. Katie's BFF and her FWB took us here for a couples date night out. The girls dressed in skimpy cocktail dresses, while Noah and I dressed in slightly slimmed-down versions of a tuxedo. Quay Sydney is one of the most expensive restaurants in town with an eight-course menu starting at $350 (AUD), and a &quot;Benchmark Wine Pairing&quot; for a cool $1,100 (AUD). Chef Peter Gilmore and Noah are friends, so tonight became a very special foursome dining experience. We started off with a bottle of Scotch -- the Talisker 40yo Bodega Series -- and paired it with pan-seared ribeye strips. The eight-course meal was a mix of all that is wild about this continent: raw sea scallops, Oscietra caviar, chamomile broth, bone marrow noodles, roasted duck with Morello cherries and black garlic, confit pig jowl, and prunes covered in dark chocolate. Eroticism for your mouth. As for the wine pairing, see below for some of the bottles we consumed (not in any particular order):  *2008 Mount Difficulty Pinot Noir, Central Otago, New Zealand *2021 Best's Young Vine Meunier, Great Western, Victoria, Australia  *2004 Ch\u00e2teau Mont-Redon Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape Grenache blend, Rh\u00f4ne Valley, France *1964 Henriques & Henriques Sercial Madeira Garrafeira, Madeira, Portugal  *2021 Robert Weil Trocken Riesling, Rheingau, Germany *2020 Andr\u00e9 Perret Coteau de Chery Viognier, Condrieu, France *2021 Lake Folly Chardonnay, New South Wales, Australia  *2017 Domaine Simha Beauregard Pinot Noir, Tasmania, Australia  *2018 Jean Grivot Vosne-Romanee, Burgundy, France  *2018 Massolino Barolo, Piemonte, Italy   Not that we had any room for it, but Chef Gilmore insisted we try his specialty dessert: &quot;the moment in time.&quot; Which, of course, he made personally. The desert was rushed to our table, then the magic happened. You're actually tasting the chocolate in a really pure form, and you think it would be heavy, but it's actually really light. It almost looks like a sponge cake, but it's lighter than air, and with the warmth of your mouth, the chocolate virtually disappears and leaves this beautiful chocolate essence in your mouth. It's perhaps one of the beautiful contradictions of the desert, that so much time, energy, and chocolate could be expended in pursuit of a single, perfect, ephemeral moment. It was a gastronomic orgasm to be sure -- like, OMG!!  At 2AM we finally said goodnight to Chef Gilmore. Thank God we had hired a limousine that evening... but we should have also hired a forklift. LOL.   Quay Sydney defines fine-dining in Australia. It's worth your time and your wallet. Say, &quot;bucket list.&quot;",
            "Yummy yummy yummy.. One of the best meals I had while in Sydney. Chef Peter Gilmore and Quay made the list for &quot;five years on the World's 50 Best Restaurant list and held the title of Best Restaurant in Australia for three of those years&quot;.  Located right across from the Sydney Opera House in the Rocks and next to the Sydney Harbor Bridge, the restaurant is in the heart of the harbor.  It's located on the 4th floor of the boat terminal, giving you an amazing view as you dine.  We were looking directly out the window at the Harbor Bridge itself, lit up in all of its glory on a clear spring night.  The service at Quay is impeccable, everything you expect of a high end restaurant.  The food brought out and presented to you at the same time - the details matter.  This restaurant only offers a 6 course or a 10 course tasting menu, and everyone at the table must select the same number of courses - which left a lot to decide if you can't agree.  But after the decisions are made, sit back and relax and leave everything up to Chef Gilmore and his team.  We opted for the 6 course menu and here's what it looked like:  *Amuse Bouche - unfortunately I can't remember what the tart consisted of but it was rich and delicious!  Please serve this as part of your menu!   *Hand Harvested Seafood with Virgin Soy, Seaweed, and Aged Vinegar - the seafood comes in a bowl that looks like a crustacean.  They give you tweezers so you can hand stack each bite with every single element to give you a burst of flavors as you take in each bite.  The squid/octopus tentacles with the other elements (I can't even begin to tell you what everything is) is bursting with flavor and paired together so perfectly! 5/5  *Osetra Caviar with Smoked Eel, Walnuts and Sea Cucumber Crackling - this is another dish that plays with flavor and textures.  The crackling sea cucumber is nothing I've ever tasted before and adds so much to the smoked eel mousse and caviar.  Lovely, rich, but elegant. 5/5  *Steamed Mud Crab Custard with Garden & Sea Greens - You pour the dashi over the mixture and it's a burst of flavors in your mouth.  I didn't notice any mud crab but the custard had amazing flavors mixed with the garden and sea greens. 5/5  *Salmon Roe and Butter on a Crumpet - we were surprised with an additional course of salmon roe and butter on a crumpet off menu.  The crumpet was soft but toasted on on side.  The butter and salmon roe made it taste like a salmon cream cheese bagel, but of course more elegant and refined.  My least favorite dish of the night because it wasn't as amazing as the other dishes. 3/5  *Bone Marrow Pasta with White Asparagus, Koji and Garum Butter - It had good flavors but I was expecting more when I read bone marrow pasta.  The pasta was cooked well but it wasn't as extravagant as the other dishes presented. 4/5  *Smoked Pig Jowl with Black Lipped Abalone, Shiitake and Fan Shell Clams - that pig jowl definitely melts in your mouth cause of all that fat.  It was delicious and tasted fantastic.  I was hoping being the main course, you would get more than 1-2 bites but the dish was as small as the other courses. Amazing texture, melts in your mouth like butter, delicious flavors. 5/5  *You get to choose your main dish, between 2 options - the pork jowl or the roasted Maremma duck.  Nobody got the duck so we didn't get to try this dish.  For dessert, you get to choose between the White Coral or the Moo.  I chose the Moo and quickly realized why they named it that - just look at that bowl, it was made perfectly for this dessert.  Rich, sweet, decadent and chocolatey.  Delicious dessert.  The White Coral was a bit on the lighter side - coconut, some kind of fruit reduction in the middle.  I hear my Moo was better according to a friend.  And if you aren't full from dinner, they surprise you with some canneles and honey tarts after dinner and you leave with a memorabilia of the menu and some Valrhona chocolates in a cute little box.  They sure do think of everything!  The details, the plating, the actual plates, the service and the food makes this place an amazing addition and a lovely treat for those visiting Sydney!"

            "What a hidden gem! This cute restaurant is located right next to Darling Harbour but away from all the tourist traps. We find a voucher on Groupon and decided to try it out.   Once inside we checked in for our reservation and were seated immediately. We ordered a mock-tail and well as a cocktail. Both were very tasty and brought out fairly fast.  For our entrees (appetizers) we ordered the escargot and the mushroom leek crepe. The crepe I didn't try however my partner seemed to love it. However the escargot was PHENOMENAL! Such a delicious amount of garlic which you can dip the two pieces of bread afterwords in to make your own garlic break...thank me later ;)  For our mains I ordered the duck while my partner ordered beef. Both dishes were presented beautifully and were accompanied by a delicious sauce and side. My favorite part of the duck was the crispy skin which was seasoned so wonderfully.   For dessert we both goth the sticky date pudding. With every bite we were impressed. The dessert was sweet but not overly sweet. The ice cream adds the perfect touch.  Definitely recommend this place and I hope to be back soon!",
            "Pretentious. Nice view. Classy.    Calamari was the highlight.  Firm not chewy. Thick cut.  Delicious in the sauce.   The escargot was very buttery, cooked well. However I have had better.   Pate was plentiful.  Too much we couldn't eat it all. Great flavor. Requested extra bread.    The veal was so good!   Topped with a creamy mushroom sauce, enough to cover every nite.  Very rich.  Meat was tender.   This is the type of establishment that waits till you've finished your course before they move on to the next.  Be sure to tell your server you are ready if your plates still appear to be full. The server had a French accent. There was conversation amongst the table if it was real or not lol.  I believe it was, and really did add to the authenticity of the restaurant.",
            "Exceptional little restaurant in a convenient location.   A short walk away from the Convention light rail station and The Harbourside mall, the Little Snail offers 3-course lunch and dinner options. The menu is distinctly French with an Australian twist, and an extensive wine list to match.   The calamari was delicious, tender and crispy. The veal and the lamb were also great options.   The portions are quite generous and the 3 courses are plenty to fill up hungry adults."

After I ordered my food, it took them a whole 2 MINUTES to make my food and give it to me which is completely unacceptable. I am certain I was overcharged because the bill came up to $372.67, but according to my calculations the bill should have only been $320. There were not enough chairs in the lobby, so I asked for them to go buy chairs from IKEA to accommodate my family, however, they looked at me like&quot;  I was insane and said &quot;Absolutely not, you can sit on the ground&quot; After opening my take away I realised it was full of 15 sachets of soy sauce??? I went to complain but the employees jumped out the windows and ran away. Once they came back I asked for the number to complain about them.

            "I havent tried many Korean restaurants in Sydney but Madang is definitely the best I have had!  Four of us came here on Boxing Day at 6.30pm and the line was not too bad, we got seated within 5 mins.  Food was really good:  Seafood pancake - Crispy, not overfried. (the small portion is good for four people as an appetizer) Jap Chae - Love it ! The noodles was seasoned well......love the fragrance of sesame oil.  Ox tail soup - With a little bit of salt/ pepper/ scallions - perfect! Goes really well with some white rice ...compliments well with BBQ  Unfortunately the BBQ is not as good as O-Bal-Tan (next door) because 1) Madang uses a mixture of coal+ gas for the grill.... 2) the grill pan is not well oiled, thin slices of beef kept getting stuck on the pan grill.  However, i still love the food! Cant wait to come back here to try other dishes",
            "One of the best Korean BBQs in Sydney! Tucked away in a little alleyway on Pitt St, it's very hard to find, but worth the effort. You must try the thin beef skirt, and boneless marinated beef ribs.   The little side dishes that accompany the meal are also perfect! Free refills :)"

            "Crinitis Restaurant, please come to Los Angeles!!!  My daughter and I were visiting family in Sydney over past couple of weeks. One day we went into Darling Harbor and happened upon Crinitis!  We had the most wonderful time there.  The staff, especially RIGZIN, the Assistant Manager, the delicious food that was delivered quickly and hot and did I say delicious, the atmosphere and the views of the harbor.  Lets put it this way, we could think of no other place we would rather go a week later, and the night before we had to fly back to LA, than to go back there for a farewell dinner with my parents.  We made sure to book around 730pm and request the balcony seating, so we could enjoy the Saturday night Darling Harbor fire works show, and again we were treated with smiles and fun by our waitress OLGA and Assistant Manager RIGZIN, came by again to make sure we were  happy and was there anything else he could do to make our experience even better!    Crinitis at Darling Harbor is an epic place to go with a group for fun and also for an romantic dinner for two on the balcony.  I would give it 100 stars if I could!!  Can't wait to head back to Sydney again soon.  First stop - Crinitis!",
            "Perfection! Pure perfection!! Where do I start? Overnight stays in Sydney have become somewhat of a regular occurrence over the past five years; and I always look forward to trying a different restaurant experience. Thanks to this app I have found hidden gems for an amateur foodie from Newcastle that are usually only known by locals. Tonight's choice was to dine at Criniti's Harbourside, Darling Harbour. I chose to dine here tonight based on the extensive menu...so much to choose from; they have something for anyone, any taste or any mood!  I will start with the view...breathtaking!!! I cannot recall seeing Darling Harbour at night, and what a beautiful night it is has been. We arrived and the restaurant inside was packed (as I have learned it is always a good sign of a great meal in Sydney). We were lead by the greeter through the dynamic and electric ambience of the inside seating outside to the million dollar view of Darling Harbour. We were seated and started browsing the menu. I already knew what I was going to get Freshly Shucked Sydney Rock Oysters Kilpatrick style to start and for main, Fettuccine Carbonara (always my staple and safe go-to), while my mother ordered Boscaiola with Gnocchi as recommended by our very welcoming waitress and my father the spaghetti bolognese. Considering the restaurant appeared to be nearing capacity, our starter Oyster Kilpatrick extremely fast!!! The oysters were amazing on their own, but combined with Criniti's Kilpatrick sauce and the bacon are equal first of all time that I have eaten. I found it so difficult to refrain from licking the oyster shell clean of the sauce remaining, I didn't think it would be very appropriate . No sooner than our lovely waitress had cleared our oyster tray and share plates, arrived our mains. The serving size...woah ENORMOUS!!!!! (See pics although I don't think the photos do the serving size justice really). The house made pasta was so beautifully rich, the cured meats in the carbonara and Boscaiola were so flavoursome, and the gnocchi OMG... that gnocchi though, the meatball with the spagbol had such a depth of flavour  I really wanted to get dessert, anything with Nutella as the main ingredient would do, but I was just wholly satisfied with my savoury starter and main, my dessert stomach just isn't functioning tonight.   Thanks to the staff at Criniti's for a wonderful evening!! You deserve so much more than five stars!",
            "OMG!  Everything about this place is amazing.  The service. The menu. The motorbike above the bar. The spirit selection. The cocktails. The wine list. The process of being seated. The food. The prices. The decor. The sheer size of the place. The atmosphere. The cocktail glasses. The pizza. The pasta. The salads.  Everything! Go here, take lots of people order a dish each and share just so you can sample more of the menu.  Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum."

Really bland and expensive at $29. x Salmon- this was more flavoursome but still not amazing for $29. x Lychee cocktail- delicious and refreshing! Not too sweet, just perfect and only $8. x Coffee cocktail- this was also another delight though I preferred the lychee."

Being a regular drinker at the Forresters I decided it was time to check out the new place upstairs and see what all the fuss was about.   Queenie's is Carribean/Jamaican food - and good lord it is AMAZING.   We tried the Pork Bammies, which were OK. I would recommend skipping them and going straight for the BBQ Jerk Corn. &quot;WTF?&quot; I hear you say. Just you wait and see. The Cervice is great and the Jerk Chicken with Jungle Slaw is to die for. Do I seem over the top with my praise? I haven't even gotten to the glory of the doughnuts yet!!  Do yourself a favour and check this place out. Share the plates with friends. And hey, it's actually cheaper to drink the beers up at Queenie's than downstairse in the bar... go figure.",
            "What do you do when your friend just came back from a month long holiday through South America and the Caribbean, and telling you stories of great adventure and all the amazing food she enjoyed? You visit Queenie's of course!  The entrance to this place is not easy to spot. You need to go through The Forrester then take the colourful stairs that will lead you to Queenie's.  Since it's my first experiencing Caribbean food, I was overwhelmed with choices. The waitress noticed and asked, &quot;Is it your first time here?&quot; To which I replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; She recommended the Half and Half where you'd get Jerk Chicken, Jerk Ribs, 2 Grilled Corn, Sweet Potato Fries and Island Slaw. Tender chicken, fall of the bone ribs, grilled corn on the cob covered with shredded coconut and tasty sweet potato fries. Delicious!  We also ordered the Voodoo Chicken Wings. Comes with cooling coconut dipping sauce, the chicken wings were deep fried goodness covered in tasty hot sauce. It was finger-lickin', mouth-smackin' good!  The staff were warm and attentive. And do try their cocktails. I tried the Kraken & Fresh Apple, it was sweet and refreshing with freshly squeezed apple juice. I left feeling slightly more cultured and I can nod to my friend's Caribbean holiday stories with the feeling that I'd been there too or at least tasted some of it!",
            "We came here for date night on a Friday and we were seated next to a dingy red light - well, the entire place has this dodgy red glow! Sets the mood I suppose.   We shared the Puerto Rican avocado and plantains, which is basically an avo dip with plantain chips. A great starter so no complaints here. I also ordered the ceviche for $18 that you can view in the photos - I absolutely LOVE ceviche, because it's so hard to do it well. Sadly, while I was happy with the rest of the food, the ceviche was a sore disappointment. Stay away from the ceviche! You can barely taste the scallops and they're served on weird delicate chips. Not the ceviche cured in a bed of lime juice that I'm used to. Finally, the chicken and ribs were amazing. Next time, we'll order more chicken and ribs and no ceviche. Definitely worth a second visit!"

Grilled pork rice bowl, crab omelette served on a grilled croissant, or mushroom risotto just to name a few.   The staff were as attentive as possible considering how busy they were with takeaway orders and diners in alike. I had the grilled pork rice bowl, which I found to be delicious especially with the dressing that came with. Despite my dislike of pink radishes, it was flavoursome to say the least and the pork was really of melt-in-your-mouth quality.   The coffee led a lot to be desired, i found my mocha to be bitter sweet more than anything else and just a little lacklustre.

They were busy and it took 15 minutes, but the staff were super friendly and considerate. Called us when the table was ready. Kids were happy playing. I got the Eggs Benedict with shredded pork and my wife got the Risotto. Both were absolutely incredible. Lots of flavor and hit the spot. Risotto was super rich with mushroom and truffles. Kids even wanted a second meal so we got scrambled eggs, toasted brioche, and a side of avocado. I realize that kid orders are complicated (because they are so boring and simple) and they were very receptive.   Coffee was good (4 starts) but not the best I've had. Didn't matter we were so happy with everything else it was a great experience. Can't wait to come back, won't even have to go to Pancakes on the Rocks first, which is awesome."

The smell of fresh brewing coffee wakes you up, and the temperature of the air inside was perfect, even with the door open on a humid day.   But back to the taste- the most important part. I ordered and iced rose latte and it was just sweet enough, Rose syrup as a sugar replacement is unique enough to make it an experience traveling for. I had the eggs Benedict with ham for brunch, and every aspect of the plate was well thought out. The hollandaise was delicious, the bread was fluffy, and the eggs were perfectly cooked and runny.

You are greeted with a Hello and Goodbye as if you are welcome whenever. The vibe in Betty's Burger suits the beachy theme and I'm a huge fan of it especially this bang on spot in Darling Harbour. Could be improved trying to ward off seagulls in anyway as they like to scramble for some leftovers once in a while.  I loooveeeee the onion rings here. Worth coming here for the onion rings. Betty's Classic or Betty's Deluxe are my favourites. The Supreme Chicken is alright. Maybe it's just not for me but the chips are questionable at times. They are overburnt or have black markings on them at the bottom sometimes. I would just get the onion rings over the chips.  All in all, I love this place and always come here for a quick lunch or quick dinner when I'm playing ping pong near the area.",

Listen I don't know how much you really want me to say aside from the fact the burgers are delicious, the fries are delicious and even though I didn't have a shake, I saw that my friends were really enjoying their's. If I wasn't on another continent at the moment, I would be eating Betty's Burgers on the regular.

We were promptly showed to a table which they had prepared with enough room for the pram. Nice airy, location outside the ICC Exhibition Centre & just opposite the park.  The food was great, juicy burgers with cloud soft buns, fresh lettuce & tomato. Chips were hot & crispy, and the garlic mayo dipping sauce is too damn good! The only minor issue we had was there were a couple of items that weren't brought out. However  the staff were quick & attentive and promptly resolved this on the spot. To make up for any inconvenience, they even gave us a free concrete (like a sundae but better).  All in all, I'm impressed with this Sydney location, the burgers are up there with the best of Sydney, the staff are friendly and great to see they have high standards in customer service.  Looking forward to when their Manly store opens up in the new future, a bit closer to home & out of the hustle & hustle of Darling Harbour."

            "Excellent service. They cook your meat for you to ensure it is in the perfect temperature and not overcooked. It's also cool that a large part of the restaurant is outdoors. The meat was good and the sides and salads was perfect to wrap the meats.   This area is Asian food heaven. You'll be so happy when you find a place like this. It feels like Hong Kong. It feels like Vietnam. It feels like Korea. Great walking area with no cars. Love it.",
            "During my time here at Sydney I came here twice. The hot coal grill in an outdoor setting was perfect for Korean BBQ. It isn't all you can eat like the states but I was satisfied with the amount of meat provided. The servers cook for you throughout the entire meal. The meat was very tender and high quality. The egg soup was amazing and the seafood pancake was also very delicious. I didn't feel like I overate like all the times I eat Korean BBQ. One of the best Korean BBQ I ever had along with it being outdoors your clothes don't smell as much."

You can see everything they cook in front of you and how they prepare it. The place is small and decoration is minimal, walls are black. The cooker likes to play games that involve catching bowls and food in your mouth. The environment is very friendly and welcoming. I recommend anyone to visit, you are sure to have a good time. My experience was fun and very good.   Example of price: for 3 people, our bill was around $170   Meals are around $50, $30 per head, depends on what you order."

They grill a steaks right there in the same room- the steaks were delicious. The candle- yes candle, is made out of beef fat and they melt it in front of you!! Bread was delicious, we started with gnocchi. Had Brussel sprouts (so good) and potatoes and of course a bottle of wine!!!!",

One of the most unique restaurants I've been to, it's a speakeasy entrance so don't walk by it... watch ling them cook your steak over open fire can't be beat. Must visit with you friends, family or significant other!",
            "can you live without your phone for an hour or 2??? if the answer is NO, go elsewhere!!!  yes, strictly no phones allowed in the dining room! you surrender your phones upon entering their dining room and will only be reunited when you finally pay!  still keen? take a stroll down george street towards the circular quay, like I did. a right onto dalley street will line you up with their nondescript entrance. down some stairs, through another door and you are at the bar. for once, the bar fronts the 'hidden' restaurant! speakeasy the bar isn't but their dining room is obscured from plain sight, behind!  i came without a reservation but managed to secure a counter top seat right by the charcoal fire! once they lock your distracting phones out of the way, the menu, water and wine flowed.  oh red wine on tap? perfect! slightly sparkly, served in a tumbler ala italian style, if you don't mind.  then homemade focaccia welcomes you! served with a side of candle? not any ordinary candle! but an exquisite beef fat candle for you to dip in as it melts!  decision time and bone marrow, bistecca, brussels sprouts, 3Bs ftw! a strange liberating feeling ensued. the duty to take a photo of all the experiences was replaced by the actual experience itself!  bone marrow was perfectly melt in the mouth with a parmesan crust that provided an accentuated texture. the main event however will take some time to craft. there's but one t-bone cut of meat here, just choose how thick and how well done, recommended medium rare. then sitting back watching the professional expertise in action, the master of raw fire, was just such a bliss. simply put the bistecca stood no chance. from the bone chilling sawing, to the branding by cast iron weights against the grills blistered by hot charcoal embers, finishing in and out of a warm oven for that perfect temperature before being carved for easy devouring, orgasmic. masterful teamwork all around, easy to miss if one was constantly on their devices! :) was also awestruck by the brussels sprouts, blackened but not burnt, balanced with the right acidity from balsamico, topped with a gently sharp pecorino and a cooling sour cream finish at the bottom.  so do we really need our phones? a want or a need? sure, this review would probably benefit with some photos of the inner sanctum to prove the talk. but perhaps your engagement would be better for it? the jury is still out........"

Will definitely be coming back again!!!",

It is definitely a far less formal affair, but the prices reflect that (in fact it only costs a little more than food court fare) and if you don't mind a casual dining ambience in the middle of a casino then you are in for a treat.  The spanner crab special (not on the main menu) was a mere $21 dollars and is literally finger lickin' good. The duck curry was also wonderful (the duck had nice crispy skin and a healthy serving of vegetables and had a wonderfully subtle sauce wherein the heat built up slowly.  I am definitely coming back here. It even makes up for the $25 parking fee for the casino."

We tried the Yayoi Gozen - this is the perfect dishes to try all of Yayoi favourites which includes the pork loin cutlet, salmon salad, salmon teriyaki and the Wagyu sukiyaki.  We love how Yayoi continues the traditional of meals consisting of one soup dish and three other dishes providing a good balance of nutrients which is believed in japan to be the foundation of a healthy diet.   We also had the delicious Unagi Hitsumabushi Teishoku. Ellen's first time trying unagi couldn't have been better with this dish! The kinme-mai rice used has 10% fewer calories than the other rice used so you have more room for dessert.  Now of course- to the dessert , we recommend the matcha warabi mocha and the matcha anmitsu. This is the perfect finish to a well balanced meal leaving you satisified.",

A cool aspect of this restaurant is that you order on ipads, which is a pretty cool touch that is different than other restaurants. Since I am a sucker for some good salmon sashimi, I got the raw salmon sashimi don, which comes with miso soup. The salmon is on top of a bowl of rice with shredded tamago and seaweed. The salmon was fresh and buttery, and the whole dish was satisfying and delicious! I would definitely come back to try their other dishes!",
            "Nice place to hang out with friends. Food was very delicious and price was surprisingly not expensive! We went on thurs at 6 and only had to wait for 15 mins for a table for 4. They have really good services and we ordered everything on the computer. The food that amazed me was the dessert, not so sweet and sticky. Though i will not compare the food with the top japanese ones, i'd say this restaurant is good enough for casual japanese dinner.  We finished our dinner around 8pm and there was still a long queue waiting outside, couldnt imagine how popular it is!  I will definitely go back again with my family again."

Everything from Two Good Eggs Breakfast, to the toast with honey, apples, walnuts, and goat cheese, to their croissant breakfast sandwiches were amazing.  And I have no words for the bacon: way better than American bacon - a good chunk of meat but also crispy ... Yum!  We did try a couple of other places but they did not compare. We ended up coming back here on our last 2 mornings in the city   One thing is they don't have any fresh fruit which my friend was kinda craving. Otherwise, everything was great: food, service, ambiance.  I recommend coming here, even if you're not staying next door - you'll love it!",

To paraphrase a line from Mel Brooks, &quot;It's good to know the King.&quot; LOL.   Tucked into the side of the Sydney Opera House, Bennelong affords stunning views of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the city lights.

That being said, dearest reader, whatever you eat, you must leave room for dessert. Classy, romantic, sophisticated, innovative, prix-fixe, and pre-theatre dining -- it's all here at Bennelong.   Ironically on that last note, sometime over 200 years ago, Bennelong Point was a tidal rock island in the heart of the Gadigal lands. It has been said that this was a location for Aboriginal women to congregate on the rising tide, eat shellfish by the fire, and tell stories. Telling stories. Sharing stories. Our night consisted of marvelous food and drink and stories. What a wonderful and sentimental way to say our goodbye to Sydney. Katie and I will definitely return.

            "We first visited their flagship bar/restaurant - Bar Tapavino which quickly became one of our favourite restaurants. Not long after, they opened another standout - Balcon, which we also greatly loved. This restaurant group have since opened a relatively new addition, situated in Barangaroo, called Born. This restaurant group has a simple recipe for running and it works well -  their drinks have a focus on wine and sherry, sprinkle in some great food, as well as a high standard of service.   We visited Born by Tapavino to round out the trifecta of our visits to the restaurants in the Tapavino range, and we had heard great things about it. This restaurant has a beautiful setting by the water at Barangaroo and with an alfresco dining space as well, it makes for an ideal place to visit for a wine accompanied lunch, afternoon drinks or an evening dining experience.  Drinks wise, at this sort of establishment, we are comfortable to leave it with the staff and you will not be disappointed. The sommeliers do a great job of picking drinks to your preference and matching it with the food you have ordered. Amandine recommended a beautiful red wine which was superb and matched the food incredibly well. One of us was driving on this occasion, and we left it in the bartenders hands to concoct a delicious mocktail.  The tapas (individual bites) had us salivating when trying to decide. We rested on the balmain bug and prawn sliders. The sliders did a good David Copperfield impersenation, they vanished soon after arriving at the table.  The highlight of the tapas experience were some manchego churros are were a revelation. Some soft fried dough topped with the smoked chorizo mayo, so good they should bottle it. Whilst the regular dessert churros have always been good, savoury ones now have our vote. We could have eaten a bucket.   Moving on to primera, these dishes are a larger and great for sharing. We couldn't visit and not try the warm cow's milk cheese wrapped in jamon serrano which is served with truffled honeycomb. This dish is heaven on a plate, if sharing you will do battle for your share.  The mains also great for sharing. The lamb rump was perfectly prepared, sauced with chimichurri to cut through the richness of the meat. This was served with papas fritas tiny fried potato battons, which provided some crunch to the dish and the smoked paprika taking this dish to another level. Paired this with a nice glass of red suggested by the sommelier, Perfecto!  You will need to save room for dessert, as it is a highlight, better yet, just channel the dessert stomach. So many amazing options, the bunuelo (spanish doughnuts) doughnuts must be selected to put a bigger smile on your dial. The dessert special for the evening - a dulche de leche and dark chocolate ganache tart was spectacularly decedent. The chololate and mixed nuts with peanut butter caramel and also the arroz con leche helado, this is a classy Spanish ice cream sandwich and was a clear standout. Make sure this is paired with one of the amazing sherries on offer, the pairing takes this dessert to out of this world good.  Born by Tapavino, is one of our favourite venues for 2017. Great food, drink and service. What else does one need? Nothing.",
            "Tapavino is a go to restaurant for me! The service is always amazing and food is always consistent. I've been to all the Tapavinos in Sydney and each location is always great. It's an awesome location for every event. The wine list is incredibly extensive and the food is designed to be shared. The humble pan con tomate is my staple each visit! You can't go wrong with the jamon, beef cheeks and the shaved cabbage! Highly recommend."

            "In Japan you get your yakitori (chicken-on-a-stick) fix in izakayas, informal gastro-pubs where salary men fill in the void between work finishing and dinner. Heading up a &quot;young but enthusiastic&quot; team, Tin Jung Shea (ex-The Cliff Dive) has recreated the same super-relaxed drinking atmosphere right here in Crows Nest.  Settle in for beverages and bites at the polished concrete bar with a bird's-eye view of the stick-flipping action, or pull up a table and turn your visit into a casual dinner using clever sides. First on the agenda is washing away the sorrows of your work-life with a palate cleansing ale. The one to drink here is the golden Orion Draft ($8/400ml) from Okinawa - the hip, sub-tropical outpost of Japan. It's crisp, refreshing and mild enough to be a great sake chaser if you're a fan of double-parking.  You know I am, so against a bowl of Edamame ($4.90) and some even better Burdock Root Chips ($4.90) that make a tasty, lightly seasoned alternative to potato chips, I got stuck into sake. The Yurippi team prepared me three tokkuri (flasks) of different sakes and gave me some tips on which dishes they'd suit best. You can get them to do the same, or skip straight to my favourite, the Yuki-no-Bousha ($25/300ml), which has a full, round flavour that makes it a hit with grilled meat.  Start with the classic - Chicken Thigh and Shallot ($2.90/each) accentuated by sweet soy - before you hit the star: Tsukune ($4.50/each). Popular in Japan, these house-made chicken meatballs are made by mincing chicken thighs with soft bones for added texture, shallots, ginger and garlic, basted with sweet soy, and served up with a runny 63-degree egg.  They're also making their own dashi (a Japanese stock) using sake, shitake stems, soy, mirin and kombu, which is put to excellent effect in a delicate, Japanese Omelette ($4.90). The long, brown seaweed (kombu) is also employed in butter form to accentuate sashimi-grade Scallops ($4.50/each). Handle them carefully though, coming straight off the grill, the shells are scorching hot.  At the more fun end of things, there are Bacon-Wrapped Mochi ($4.50) skewers made using glutinous rice cakes. They have a texture similar to roasted marshmallow, without being as sweet. Or there's Japanese fried chook, called Karaage ($4.90), served up here in a mini fry basket with Kewpie mayonnaise.  Now while kombu is the taste I'll most remember this spot for - especially on the super simple Cabbage ($4.90) side - eating my first oden was a very close second. This warming chicken broth is sold in Japanese convenience stores, with the floating additions added like we select lollies in a Pick-n-Mix! You can either let the Yurippi team do the selecting for you by ordering a six-piece Oden Set ($9.90), or choose your own favourites from tofu-wrapped creamy mochi, fishcakes, egg, yam cakes, or wedges of white radish (daikon).  I'd be hard pressed to remember another dish that I've eaten that made me feel more like I was experiencing something authentically Japanese. Yes, authenticity is something this tiny but charming yakitori bar has in abundance!",
            "Authentic yakitori grilled over coals. We really enjoyed our meal. We ordered a selection of the specialities including chicken and spring onion skewers, chicken meatball with poached egg and the grilled onigiri. With 3 adults and 1 toddler we spent $175.",
            "Walking into Yakatori Yurippi was like walking into a side Alley in Roppongi. This is as good as it gets with a wide selection of tasty grilled treats. The Chicken meatball with Egg, Pork Jowl and Pork Belly are some of the many highlights. Many of the options can be served grilled with just salt, or dipped in a sweet soy marinade - delightful  The Okinawa draft beer and excellent Japanese whisky selection rounds off a fantastic experience .... right in the centre of Crows Nest"

            "We came here for the bottomless drinks lunch and it was a fantastic experience! This a cute pub loCated in the Rocks. You could tell the building was old but that was the whole point.   We reserved our lunch ahead of time. We had two hours to drink whatever we wanted. We ordered the wings small size as an entree(appetizer) and got it half spicy and half their house sauce. These wings were delicious. The spicy sauce is a Franks red hot sauce and the house sauce was a teriyaki flavored kind of sauce. Not sure what the dipping sauce was but it was so good!   My fianc\u00e9 and I ordered the steak with salad and both got mashed potatoes with red wine jus. It was sooooo good! The steak was perfectly cooked to medium rare, so flavorful and paired well with the creamy mashed potatoes! You go up to the counter/ bar to order which made everything easy.   I definitely recommend this place!",
            "I'm the type who likes the pub on a weekday night or a weekend afternoon. It's nice to have some folks around, but I prefer having space to move and relax. For that reason, Hart's Pub was perfect for me.   We stopped by around lunch time and I tried several beers. I liked each to varying degrees, but between their descriptive menu and the helpful barkeep, I knew what I was getting into each time.   The food is nice as well. We tried a few of their shared plates, and all were quite good.   The facility itself is spread amongst three levels. You just walk in and find space on your own, then order from the bar. There were only a few tables available during the afternoon, so if you absolutely want a seat, you may want to reserve ahead. Like a proper pub, however, the tables are spaced well apart, so there is ample standing room for those who just want a beer.   Overall, a very nice and unassuming pub."

The cheeseburger ($17) is larger than you expect once you lay into it, no complaints here! A juicy beef patty cooked a perfect medium, with two slices of jack cheese, pickles and the most dope ketchup/mustard combo given the warmest of hugs between a delectable milk bun. Drool city. Burgers are served with fries, ask for some gravy to really up the ante.  Service was great, not too stuffy and really helpful. If you love a great burger (a la Mary's and Mister Gee's) then you absolutely need to try this joint."

            "Awesome Malaysian restaurant!  If you've read other reviews below, there's a good reason why YouTubers (including myself) rave about this place: possibly hands down the best Malay restaurant in all of Sydney. Located across the street from Market City in Chinatown.  I only tried the Laksa Hainan Chicken so the food component of this review is only based on that dish. Who knew that 2 of my favorite Malay dishes can create so much synergy - it's like a matchmade in heaven! The noodles are a combo of the rice vermicelli and thicker yellow noodles. Broth is solid - good kick but not spicy at all, so even people who can't handle spice can eat this dish; yet, there's a complex umami flavor that's reminiscent of OG laksa with the coconut milk element. The Hainanese chicken is tender and just oh-so-good. You may be wondering how the dish is not the same without the various sauces that comes with its standard rice counterpart (usually ginger scallion, sambal, and a soy sauce-based sauce), but with the flavoring of this dish, it's not needed.  Total price for Laksa Hainan Chicken was a little less than $18 USD.  Ambience inside is wonderful and the decor makes you feel like you're back in SE Asia getting street food. Staff were also friendly, and service was fairly quick. Try this place out whenever you are visiting down under!",
            "Found this place watching Youtube foodies. This is our first time eating Malaysian food. So we went here because it was recommended by many YouTubers. Make a reservation (aka booking). They get busy. If you want to walk in, get there before 5pm as it gets really busy after.  Started with the Roti with Satay chicken. Nice crispy outside and yummy chicken inside. It came with a sauce which made it tastier.  Get the Laksa! Oh so good. Got it with Hainan Chicken. Chicken was soft. Broth was hearty with nice spicy coconut flavor.  Staff was very friendly and explained some of the dishes. Once you're done eating, pay at the front desk. Fast and efficient."

But the food was a very high-quality with lots of fresh seafood which you would expect from the fish markets. Comments about the ambience of the outside are correct it does sometimes smell and is a working fishmarket so it's not the most pleasant, but the inside is very nice",
            "This restaurant is located within the Pyrmont Fish Markets and to be honest it's not the nicest smelling location and is not really suitable for corporate or first dates unless you're not too keen on trying to impress.  The food is not too bad evidenced by the loads of Chinese and Australians the go in and out its doors of a lunchtime.  Yum Cha by day and a la carte Chinese restaurant by night this restaurant offers marginally better service with staff slightly less rude than those you will encounter at various yum cha in Chinatown.  The prawn dumplings (Har Chao) steamed are a yum cha must but these are too garlicky for my liking and I love garlic.  All their dumplings of variation include; spinach and prawn, snow pea and prawn, vegetarian, seafood combinations etc  are like deadly garlic bombs.  Steer clear if you intend on going to a meeting after lunch or want to steal a kiss.  However the soy noodles, salt and deep fried pepper calamari, roasted duck, rice noodles with BBQ pork or prawns and prawn toasts are quite delicious.  It is all standard yum cha fare but its good yum cha and reasonably priced.  As it's such a large space you won't need to queue to get a table and even if you have to wait there are plenty of seafood shops below as well as a grocer and speciality deli.  Well worth your curiousity and you bookings can be taken online.",
            "I have been to this restaurant many times. For a seafood restaurant, the fresh seafood is outmost important to me as I don't really like seafood that much. But this joint delivers - fresh, reasonable price. I mean, you can spend loads for Lobsters and crabs but you can go there with a budget in mind.   Yum Cha (Dim Sum) in this restaurant is one of my favourite. The servers aren't as rude as the ones in chinatown and they are more relaxed! You don't usually have to wait for a long time for a seat unless it is mother's day or chinese new year or other holidays.   Just an insight information, in many chinese restaurant, there are 2 waiting lists. One being the regular list for English speaking people and another list for patrons who knows inside management and can speak the same language. I think that's discrimination and although it is hard to prove, this is what is happening in chinese restaurants nowadays. So think about that people!"

From that point on you could be in another place and time. Black and white photographs line the walls and everywhere you look there are details that harken back to yesteryear. P&C's drink focus is on cocktails and spirits, but champagne comes in at a close third, with a wide selection to choose from. To add to the ambiance, they have regular sets of live music, creating a mood of refined debauchery. Who could ask for anything more? (Wellll... never mind.)   Katie and her BFF stuck with a P&C signature drink, aptly named, &quot;Party Girl With A Bad Habit.&quot; It's $25 dollars (AUD) a glass, but well, well worth it. Noah (the BFF's FWB) and I kept to the classics: he with the &quot;Income Tax,&quot; and me with the &quot;Bensonhurst.&quot; Because something needed to absorb all that alcohol, we had multiple sides of steak tartare, black truffle mac and cheese, and marinated olives.

            "We went out for dinner last night wanting something familiar to home. We had been to DTF a handful of times at home so decided to grab dinner here.  SERVICE - Wow, they were efficient here. You sat down, ordered from an iPad, checked your bill, and they brought your food. Food came out so fast! Once you were done eating, you brought up your bill to the cashier, paid and left. Easy peasy!  FOOD Green Beans - I was craving some kind of greens and knew I could get a solid set of green beans here. So much flavor. Still had the nice crunch to them and were not overcooked.  Fried Rice w Beef - Rice, egg, and meat combo was well portioned. We enjoyed this!  Xiao Long Bao Dumplings - You could see they were filled with a lot of soup. It was very savory, the meat inside was seasoned nicely, the the wrapper was perfectly steamed.  We were honestly impressed with this location. We actually do not care for it at home as it does not have that much flavor and is mediocre. However, we came here and everything was bursting with flavor. Maybe it's placebo and we just miss home food so think it's amazing here? Maybe they put MSG? No idea. But whatever it was, food was delicious."

            "So far I'm impressed. The food hasn't even come yet though, so I'll get back to you. Gluten free pizza without having to ask for it special, yes. Vegan options, yes. Flat white on its way, let's see how that goes. My first Italian dining in Sydney. Usually I have to stay away from Italian eateries because I don't eat meat or gluten but I heard a rumor Vanto wouldn't disappoint. Plus, it's in the historical Queen Victoria Building! Not to be missed.  Flat white update: 4 stars. I'd walk across the street to BlueBird cafe and have my coffee there & lunch here. But I'm a coffee snob. If you aren't fussed, you'll enjoy their offerings.",
            "It's 8pm in Sydney and we wanted pizza. Lots of things seem to close early in Sydney so there weren't many options. Vanto is in the Queen Victoria Building on level one and is open until 9pm (at the time I'm writing this). Cute little place with ample seating &quot;outside&quot; the actual small restaurant but inside the shopping area.  We were greeted and seated right away and the server gave us a few moments to review the menu. We already knew we wanted a simple pizza so got the margherita and a couple Italian beers. Pizza arrived quickly and tasted great. The crust could have been a little crunchier for my tastes, but still was good. I would definitely eat here again.",
            "Wonderful spot for a glass of wine and lunch while enjoying the lovely historic QVB shopping centre.  We opted for the pizza special, a delightful pear, Gorgonzola & walnut wood-fired pie, drizzled with the best balsamic vinegar ever and topped with arugula.  Perfect to share when accompanied by a glass of wine.  Impeccable service, to boot."

            "Good ambience, excellent service and very nice food.  Went with a colleague from work and we started with the meatballs and mozzarella.  Both were very good but the mozzarella was particularly fresh and tasty.  I had the veal chop as a main.  Very large chop, breaded and nicely seasoned.  The sides were even better.  I ordered the baked pumpkin with ricotta and while hard to describe (surprisingly not sweet), interesting and I would order it again.  Even the greens were better than I expected.  A very pleasant place to spend the evening.",
            "Recommended by our Uber driver.  Excellent dinner with outstanding service.  The pasta is delicious.   Judi, Tamara & Steve",
            "From start to finish this was a first class dining experience. We had an 8:15pm reservation and upon arriving 15 mins early were asked if we wanted to wait in the bar or terrace while the host checked on our table. We chose the terrace and it was quite quiet. It was pretty chilly out there - but there were gas heaters and after 5 minutes I was given a blanket. You can order food on their terrace.  We each started with an aperitivi cocktail. Me: the Sgroppino and him: the Sea farers spritz. Both delicious.  After 10 minutes we were shown to our table up on the mezzanine - much quieter than the downstairs main room.  We started with two antipastis: the seafood and the calamari and zucchini fritti. The seafood (which was raw tuna and squid; and cooked scampi, crab, mussels) was just sublime. So fresh and tasty. It was the highlight of the night really.  For mains we had the crab pasta and the duck alla cacciatore. The crab was spicy, but not overwhelming and the pasta was fresh. The duck was really lovely, tasty and crispy skin. I think it would be perfect with some olives on the plate.  Dessert: we had gelato and a cannoli. Gelato is $8 and it's a very, very small serve. However it was delicious. I chose milk chocolate and it was like I was eating a piece of chocolate. The cannoli ($5) is the size of a packet of matches.  Service was really good - attentive but not too full on. Everyone was really friendly."
