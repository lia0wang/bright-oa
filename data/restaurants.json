            "Angeleea waited on us and she was AMAZING.My friend and I were here on December 17, 2017 and we experienced the BEST SERVICE in Sydney. Over the top service. Our lovely waitress not only gave us excellent food recommendations, but she even showed me a map of where we needed to walk to find some fresh flowers for the crematorium. We are just tourists and have no clue where to go, and it was so nice to have a helpful person.   NOW...THE FOOD. Oven baked scallops with clam meat, garlic butter and flatbread. Holy cow! Delish, and just the right amount. Loved the presentation in the pretty white shells.  Next we tried the fried squid with squid ink aioli. Again another great little meal. Very crisp and tasty.  Hot. Cheese. Dip. YESSSSS!!!! This is the one thing on the menu that we saw on their website that made us want to come here in the first place. A hot sizzling iron plate of gooey white cheese, served with warm toasty flatbread. YUM.  Elegant atmosphere and a great view of Darling Harbour. Very impressive place.",
            "I came here for dinner while looking at dozens of possibilities in the area. Everything tasted awesome. It was a little pricey. If you're looking for a place to eat at, stop by...Im kinda picky and you wouldn't be disappointed"

For food, I had the Sweet & Sour Crispy Pork Hocks, Crab Rice and the assorted dumpling platter. Everything that I had was AMAZING.

Everything about the restaurant, the food, and the service was great.   When I get the opportunity to return to Sydney this will be my first stop. Highly recommend this place!",

You cannot go wrong with this choice. For my main fare I enjoyed the Crispy Chicken. Another excellent meal all-around. The decor here also stuns. They even turned a lift/elevator shaft into a wine cellar. I guarantee if you visit, you will love it. Come here with friends, or come here alone, either way a smashing good time indeed.",
            "Wow -- So tasty!! I didn't expect to find such a place in Australia, but I was so glad I gave this place a try! Every dish was amazing, and my only regret is that I didn't order more! With the USD exchange rate the way it is, the meal here was a steal! Less than $20 USD/person for Peking Duck, Beef, Pork, and rice. I only wish I were able to try the seafood, but alas, some in my party were seafood adverse. I would love to come back one day!!!"

It was interesting to find a ribs & burger spot amongst some of the international influences and craft breweries and wineries, but I'm glad I happened upon this comfort food spot and had the best lamb burger I've ever had. The lamb was juicy and well seasoned, balanced by the greens and feta cheese, and the fluffy bun made it a great experience. The fries were a little average, but the service when it came out was fast and the servers were nice, and the relaxed ambiance made it an enjoyable lunch!",

The restaurant is clean, there were indoor & shady outside seating.  The lamb was lean, juicy, flavorful & it fell off the bones.  These were the best rack of lamb lamb I've ever had. Exceptional! I don't know what they did, how they made these,or what they rub them with, they were like nothing else.  We're in Australia and I needed to have lamb from the Barbie!",

Service: 4.5 / 5 stars Vibe: 5 / 5 stars Food: 4.5 / 5 stars  The views on the Sydney Harbour Bridge with open windows on the round tables were a must snag for our party of 5. You can even spectate the chefs cooking if you really want to through open glass. There are outside tables and I love the seats inside. There is something about the colour schemes of the restaurant that really mesh well with the vintage props for the display and comfortable seats!  Service was great with big smiles and being ushered in with a welcome. Although, loses a .5 score because sometimes it's questionable and service just tries to getaway with just doing it's job. But we felt mostly welcome coming in. Also, a great lunch / dinner spot for families as well as big parties are welcomed.  The ribs were flipping magic! So tender and melts in your mouth. The best ribs I've ever tasted and I hated ribs. The peri chicken burger was great but just does it's job. Perhaps caramlise the onions so there is more flavour. The Loaded Burger was the main stair and the flipping awesome chips! This place sells one of the best chips!  I'd recommend getting the Loaded Burger with chips at a first go."

In fact, they sell their sauces to go in jars, and I loved it so much that I brought home two jars. The chicken was cooked perfectly, and the sauce's seasoning was so on point. It was on the heavy side for a lunch dish, but I would eat that every day if I could; it was that good.   The server, who was also originally from the United States, was helpful in selecting a cocktail that I enjoyed too, though I forget the name. It was a sweeter, gin-based drink.

Underneath was the best artichoke I have ever eaten.  It was moist as if steamed, yet grilled on the barbie. It had little bitterness and added a dimension I would never have put together. This was after a Tasmanian scallop and some oysters that were great as well. It was raining and the staff went out of their way to accommodate me, thus the 5 stars."

            "With Vivid Sydney 2019 fast approaching, it is an exciting time of the year to be in Sydney. This gave us great pleasure to be a part of the launch of the Four Seasons Hotel Chroma Dinner Premiere.  The Four Seasons are getting into the Vivid festive spirit by providing a unique culinary experience at their Mode Kitchen & Bar. The Chroma dinner includes a four course meal, with each dish designed to awaken the senses, and to take you on a culinary journey of colour, scent, sound and light. Inspired by the colours red, blue, green, they have been created to enhance the dining experience.  As guests enter a newly created white room, you are suddenly transformed into a world of colour and a sensorial awakening. Prior to arriving to this dinner, the evening for us started in the Presidential Suite of the Four Seasons Hotel, and we were greeted with three rooms illuminated with the colours red, blue and green. The highlight room was the blue room with the spa bath filled with bottles of champagne, and glasses surrounding the rim of the tub, and overlooking the iconic Sydney Opera House. A stunning hotel room with 360 degrees of the city, and we got to enjoy the room all whilst sipping wine and tasting some canapes.  Following the walk around the Presidential suite, it was time for the dinner in the white room with the visual projections to enhance the food experience, by transporting guests into the middle of the jungle, under the reef or in a psychedelic world.  The first course 'fishing in the jungle' (green) included the Hiramasa Kingfish with Aboriginal green ants, herbs chlorophyll and stracciatella. This came with a cocktail 'green savannah jelly'  The second course, the 'reef promenade' (blue), was served a spanner crab risotto, purple cabbage and scampi caviar. Brilliantly blue! Served with the Toji Junmai Ginjo cocktail   The third course,  'The Devil's Bath' (red colour) included the ruby snapper with smoked strawberry gazpacho and radish. An absolutley delightful and beautifully presented dish, served with the 'strawberry fields' cocktail.  Dessert, and certainly a highlight was the 'sweet canvas' -  this was white chocolate, vanilla and mandarin sphere served with blueberry, raspberry and pistachio which looked literally, like materials to create a work of art on the place, served with the 'la vie' cocktail."

Key winners from the buffet section was the juices (comes in a sale pourer), smoked salmon, and congi (Asian rice porridge).    Would I come back?  At least once every time I visit Sydney and staying at the star",
            "We had been hearing many good things for a long time about Sokyo at the Star, not only their Japanese dinner, but also their buffet breakfast. As we began 2018, we decided it was finally time to visit. Do make sure you book ahead of time as it can be hard to secure a spot.  In attendance were our insta foodie friends and contributor Sakinav and one of the best food bloggers in Sydney: Spooning Australia, as acclaimed by the Good Food Guide. We all met at Sokyo, a modern restaurant with floral displays, neatly set tables and an inviting buffet. The place very much had a hotel feel.    We are all seated, scoped out the offerings on display at the buffet and also perused the menu. We were in two minds regarding out choice for the menu and whether to get al a carte or buffet. $22.50 for a la carte or $28 for buffet. From the ala carte menu are a range of Japanese inspired dishes. However, you can also go for the $38 for an a la carte option, buffet, tea and coffee, that is the choice! What could be better?  All of us ordered something different from the al a carte menu. Whilst we wait for the ala carte dish, we start a conga line back and forth from the buffet, shuffling around like busy little worker ants. Everyone has a hand in arranging food at the table. You'd have think there was a small army eating, not just 5.  The coffee then arrived at the table, however, with so many good boutique coffees out there, it was a little bit of a let down that they were using a large commercial brand, but I guess it will appeal to the masses. Be mindful though, some of the drinks cost extra, like the matcha or turmeric lattes.  The buffet was quite simple with a range of cakes some with a hint of Japanese flavour including yuzu or matcha. All very nice and beautifully prepared. There was fruit and yogurt as well as an allotment of beautiful cheese and meat. In typical Asian buffet style, somethings that we always love like some soba noodles, with your choice of toppings. There was also the congee, a savoury rice pudding. With this pudding, were an array of savoury condiments to add flavour, be it fried challots, spring onion, soy sauce, ginger battons or pickled plum.  The buffet was nice but paled in comparison to the a la carte menu. When the food we ordered started to arrive at the table there was much food envy. The match lamington, very Japanese was nicely presented with a yuzu curd and red bean inside. It was extremely beautiful and overall a lovely dish, despite the cake being a little dense.  The Sokyo seafood bowl was not your typical Austalian breakfast. A bowl of rice topped with an assortment of fresh seafood and an onsen egg. It started out a little standard and improved ten fold once all mixed together and flavours combining them together.  The taditional choushoku breakfast was impressive a set including miso soup, rice, fish of the day, edamame, nori, Japanese pickle and onsen tomago.  The star of the day, at the Star on this occasion appeared to be the spicy salmon udon ordered by Spooning.  As a whole, the breakfast at Sokyo was very enjoyable. The price is reasonable and the service is very good. Combining the a la carte and buffet options together is thoroughly recommended.",
            "Have been to Sokyo 3 times, impressive Japanese cuisines. Great atmosphere, huge selection of Japanese food, nice menu, wonderful drink list.  However, with all those nice options on menu, my favorite always been the Spicy Ramen...my Japanese girlfriend said it is very authentic..."

It is a hospitality training school run through Torrens University Australia, it offers courses ranging from diplomas to degree. This restaurant is their on the job work experience.   Remember it's a training school, don't be hard on the staff. That said, the staff were incredibly attentive and professional and eager to please. The manager was also an excellent teacher and we could hear her guiding the staff with her knowledge and experience on display.   The food can be described as Modern Australian. It's old school food, showing the techniques learnt in training school that term and plated with finesse.   We had the beetroot entree, so tasty and beautifully plated, and we also tried the spanned crab, just divine.  The Roasted Milly Hill lamb cutlets, rillets of lamb showing great care and precision and skill in its plating. It came with lamb shoulder, confit tomato, crispy cauliflower and jus. We had this with a side of roasted veggies.   The Herb and ricotta gnocchi was absolutely lovely and nicely flavoured with with oyster mushroom, Tuscan cabbage and garden peas.   After our meal, we were good to try a bit of dessert. The Dark Chocolate delice was nice and smooth, served with burnt white chocolate, a marshmallow whip and a peanut brittle with a bit of Turkish delight too. We loved the marshmallow addition to this dish.   Ranked 5th on trip advisor, we can see why! It is a high quality dining experience, marvellous food and served in an efficient manner. What a great initiative to give these staff vocational training whilst gaining support and development.",
            "This is an interesting and fun concept, where culinary students prepare the food and wait on the tables. But don't assume that makes anything about the experience amateurish. All of the food we had was top notch, and the service was friendly and professional, even if there were a few details that weren't perfectly polished.  Perhaps because it is a training environment the prices are extremely reasonable, both for food and wine. There's no question that it's the best value of all of Sydney's fine dining restaurants.",
            "Thoroughly enjoyed a dinner here pre Covid. Looking forward to returning. 3 courses for a reasonable price. Nice staff and ambiance."

Plus you have a nice view of the harbor and city. They have outdoor seating as well but it was a little chilly for that when I was there. We had the margarita pizza which was delicious! Service was great and I would come again.",

My favorite meals are the Bugs, Thai papaya salad, steaks and any of the seafoods, Zucchini flowers are a must have. Opens at 6 pm so get there early as it's always packed especially on the weekends."

My husband was craving steak and I was craving a good meal with a great view. 6 Head delivered on all of the above.   To start, the atmosphere is a step above any other restaurant we visited in Sydney. The service was phenomenal and we were able to snag a table for two outside without a reservation.  The staff was friendly and attentive but not obnoxiously interruptive of our meal.   My husband ordered the Caesar salad and a steak, which was cooked perfectly. I ordered the burrata to start and  chicken as my main with a sort of corn mash: both were to DIE for!  I also ordered a glass of Rose from an Aussie winery in VIC which very nicely complimented the meal. I'll be looking for the wine back in the states, and hope to recreate the corn mash in my own kitchen as well   We highly recommend 6 Head to tourists and locals alike!"

Like next door, it is self service so order at the counter and make sure you pick up a black tray to collect your food on. Pick up any drinks you want before ordering your food as well. You can then select from their hot food station to add any extras if a bit more ravenous. Service is polite and efficient.  I went with Ontama Teriyaki Chicken Bowl, and Curry Croquette. You can choose between having a regular and large bowl as well. The chicken was tasty and had a nice flavour to it. Rice was well seasoned with the sauce. The egg could've been cooked slightly longer as very runny. The croquette had a nice crunch and nice potato filling.",

In my research, one of the places that keeps coming up was Hurricane's Grill.    So I headed there after a rainy day at the museums around 3 pm, but I learned my first foodie experience in Sydney - a lot of restaurants are closed between 3 pm and 5 pm.  So if you are looking for a meal around that time, you better have a snack.  So, I went back to my hotel and then return later on that evening!    Hurricane's Grill was established in 1994 in Sydney's famous Bondi Beach. It is styled in similar concept of a South African steakhouse by co-founder and owner of Craig Goldberg.     I ordered:     a half slab of beef ribs (gluten free).  garlic bread   and a salad because I need balance.    The meat was mouth-watering, tender, and tasty. The  basting sauce, which was developed by Craig's father, was delicious. The garlic bread.. had just the right about of garlicky goodness. The salad had the freshest tomatoes.  Oh, by the way, a half of slab of beef ribs was too much for me!",
            "Hurricanes is a bar and grill famous for their succulent ribs and BBQ meat. The Hurricanes menu is that popular, they have a number of venues around Sydney. You can guarantee a good protein fix there! We visited the Darling Harbour location and you can find it in the Harbourside shopping centre overlooking the harbour with a view of the Sydney skyline.  It is a spacious venue with floor to ceiling glass to take advantage of the views. It is extremely large with plenty of tables, a bar and open plan so you could easily host a large party. We arrived at 12 noon and within 15 minutes the place was packed! It clearly is very popular and for good reason.  We were promptly taken to our table by lovely staff and seated right at the windows with a lovely outlook. We perused the menu and began with some drinks. The passionfruit mojito was excellent, and you can also get a number of other cocktails, beers and wines from their bar.  Food wise, we obviously ordered some ribs!Hurricanes are famous for their ribs and steaks and they use a unique basting sauce to provide a lovely flavour to their meats. Meat cuts are all halal certified from their suppliers and can have no sauce upon request. Since we wanted a try of all of them, we opted for the meat platter with pork, lamb and beef ribs. Whilst they were all good, pork was our favourite. They came with some tasty fries and it was a generous serving.  Whilst hurricanes may not be known first and foremost as a seafood restaurant, but there's plenty of seafood options too and we found it to be of excellent quality. Perfectly cooked, the scallops and mussels were served in the open shell, and the platter came with split prawns, half a lobster, salmon fillet, tempura prawns and salt and pepper squid. Served atop a plate of rice, all items were delicious. Whilst we didn't have a steak on this visit, Hurricanes are notorious for their steak. There's numerous meats and cuts to select from. Whether it be the rump, strip stirloin, fillet tenderloin or T bone, you will find your perfect match. Wagyu, dry aged or long fed beef, Meats come with your choice of fries, salad or baked potato and you can order a sauce to accompany it. Hurricanes also serve other main menu items like beef cheeks, lamb cutlets, pork knuckle, grilled chicken, burgers and more. If you are super hungry or a couple wanting to share a meal Hurricanes have a number of combo deals. There's desserts to top off your dining experience.  The menu is certainly extremely approachable so we imagine it would satisfy any dining party.",
            "We stopped by during our tour of Sydney and we were very lucky to find the place only half full.  I've heard this place gets quite packed most times, most days.  We were immediately seated outside with a beautiful view of Darling Harbour on a clear sunny day!  That view alone already voted a positive two thirds for the place...  Our orders were taken quickly and arrived not too long after.  And to compliment the view...the food was indeed a mouthwatering sight...with a taste to match the presentation!  The place may be a bit expensive...but it was worth it for the service, the food and the ambiance!  You have to experience a Hurricane in Sydney..."

All the flavors went together so well, and the crunch of the crispy coating was a nice change.  This whole restaurant is set up to be insta-worthy, and while it's definitely visually appealing, it's also pleasing to the taste buds. You have to give it a visit!"

            "I was very, very happy with my lunch at Shiba's Kitchen.   Upon first walking in, you are greeting with a lot of bright, natural light that showcases the clean, modern design and the adorable Shiba Inu stuffed animals that decorate the tables and walls. The space feels very open, but has many tables to accommodate busy rushes.    Service was fast and friendly. There's a note on the menu that everything is cooked to order, not ahead of time, so service times may be slow - however our food all came out very quickly. That being said, we were not there during peak hours. But the food would have been worth waiting for! I ordered a couple pieces of tuna sushi and the spicy Korean fried chicken.  I am incredibly picky when it comes to sushi, as raw fish can be tricky and sometimes feel rubbery - but the sushi here was so fresh and tender and flavorful. And this was actually the best Korean fried chicken I've ever had.   It's my understanding that this restaurant is fairly new, but deserves publicity because it truly is fantastic! It's open for lunch until 2:30pm and then opens again for dinner around 5pm. Probably would not be great for large groups, given the set up, but definitely worth coming for lunch or dinner!",

            "Our meal here greatly exceeded my expectations. In fact, the five-course tasting menu was superior to the tasting menu we had the previous night at the famous Quay restaurant around the bend.  Each dish was comprised of a perfect melding of ingredients and flavors, with the John Dory and the perfectly cooked lamb being particular standouts. The dessert--which was really three desserts on one plate-- was also outstanding.  The wine list is a bit limited, but there are some gems such as Tyrell's Vat 47 Chardonnay.  The only failing was the service, which although attentive missed a lot that you'd expect in this caliber of restaurant. Empty plates stayed on the table too long, and I think we must have requested our wine to be repoured at least a half dozen times. I wish restaurants would just leave the bottle at the table in the European style, as it would be better for both guest and server.  Nevertheless, it was a fabulous dining experience, and perhaps my favorite restaurant experience other than Tetsuya in all of Sydney, so they are definitely knocking it out of the park here. Great restaurant.",
            "Exceptional is how I would describe the Gantry in one word.    In particular, the service was outstanding.  The Gantry is located in the Pier One hotel.  The 5 star hotel delivered top knotch 5 star service at the Gantry and throughout the hotel (I find that some 5 star / hatted restaurants do not quite deliver on the service front - but not with the Gantry!).  After taking a leisurely stroll along the harbour on Walsh Bay, my dining partner and I arrived at the steps of the Pier One hotel for lunch.  They say first impressions count, and I was wowed.  We were greeted with friendly, genuine smiles upon arriving at the steps to the hotel, from the bell boys outside, door staff, conceirge and reception.  The reception staff guided us to the restaurant.    The hotel and restaurant are new, shieke, and have a vibe of understated luxury.  The bathrooms even had a couch and a framed, wide floor to ceiling mirror!  The restaurant staff were just as friendly, and extremely attentive and polite.  We were sat right next to the harbour on a table on the outside section of the restaurant (on the wharf) straight away.    Our waitress was lovely.  No request was too much - from asking for a cocktail list when the bar was not open, to requesting the sun-shade to be raised up so that we could get a better view of the harbour.  The food and drinks were outstanding - especially the mains!  We had:  - Salmon gravlax and grapefruit entree - extremely fresh, clean taste.  I'm salivating thinking about this dish.  The novelty of the dish was that the grapefruit was the same colour as the salmon so you wouldn't know if you had a piece of fish or grapefruit until you eat it or inspect it closely.  - Scallops (one with coconut and lemongrass, one with ginger and soy sauce) - average.  - Grilled garlic butter prawns - average.  - Fish and chips main - the BEST fish and chips I've ever had, hands down.  My dining partner had the same thought.  The fish was very fresh, perfectly cooked, the batter was crispy and airy at the same time.  The chips were fat, a little bit like potato wedges, and were seasoned just the right amount.  The crisp on the chip was just right.  I'd given up all hopes in finding fish and chips I actually like - and to my surprise, I found it when I wasn't looking for it!  People say that certain beachside kiosks / cafes have the best fish and chips and I've been disappointed every time.  Now this truly is the best fish and chips I've ever had!!!  - Duck breast steak main - juicy, tender duck, and the vegetables, seasoning and sauce made the dish taste delicious.  - Sourdough bread with butter - good, but not amazing.  Unfortunately, we didn't leave enough room for dessert.    Prices are very reasonable considering the location, service, quality of food and ambience.   We were so impressed by the Gantry that my dining partner promised a return trip on the spot!    This is definitely somewhere I could go again and again.",
            "The service and food were excellent, as was the location. The agnolotti was out of this world. Surprisingly, the pumpkin spiced cake was absolutely delicious even though I am not a huge fan of pumpkin. All in all a great experience.   Even with all the above, the  restaurant  appears to be priced a bit on the high side.  We went for the Let's Do Lunch offer and shared one entree and one dessert between 2 people, didn't have any additional alcohol but the bill was still a hefty $70 per head (plus we were happy to give a tip because of the excellent service).   I would definitely go back there."

After I ordered my food, it took them a whole 2 MINUTES to make my food and give it to me which is completely unacceptable. I am certain I was overcharged because the bill came up to $372.67, but according to my calculations the bill should have only been $320. There were not enough chairs in the lobby, so I asked for them to go buy chairs from IKEA to accommodate my family, however, they looked at me like\"  I was insane and said \"Absolutely not, you can sit on the ground\" After opening my take away I realised it was full of 15 sachets of soy sauce???

            "I havent tried many Korean restaurants in Sydney but Madang is definitely the best I have had!  Four of us came here on Boxing Day at 6.30pm and the line was not too bad, we got seated within 5 mins.  Food was really good:  Seafood pancake - Crispy, not overfried. (the small portion is good for four people as an appetizer) Jap Chae - Love it ! The noodles was seasoned well......love the fragrance of sesame oil.  Ox tail soup - With a little bit of salt/ pepper/ scallions - perfect! Goes really well with some white rice ...compliments well with BBQ  Unfortunately the BBQ is not as good as O-Bal-Tan (next door) because 1) Madang uses a mixture of coal+ gas for the grill.... 2) the grill pan is not well oiled, thin slices of beef kept getting stuck on the pan grill.  However, i still love the food! Cant wait to come back here to try other dishes",
            "One of the best Korean BBQs in Sydney! Tucked away in a little alleyway on Pitt St, it's very hard to find, but worth the effort. You must try the thin beef skirt, and boneless marinated beef ribs.   The little side dishes that accompany the meal are also perfect! Free refills :)"

The cabbage that can with it was also great, and I'm not really a cabbage fan.  It wasn't a great place for my kids, the kids menu is only spaghetti, but I really enjoyed it."

            "Overdue review!! We visited Sydney, the first couple weeks of 2020. Little did we know it would be our last destination for a while. Rashays was a gem during our trip!   We were staying at the Meriton Suites just off of Darling Harbor. So a quick trip across the bridge took us right to the restaurant. At first we got pulled in by the desserts. I was craving some solid sticky date pudding. Hubs accidentally ordered the sticky cookie instead. Not a bad mistake at all!!!    As we were enjoying our desserts, we read through the book of their menu (synonymous to Cheesecake Factory's), we realized we JAD to try some of their dishes. This began our 2 week relationship, lol. We went back over and over to try as much of the menu in each visit as we could finish (which was really only a 3 course meal shared between us).    The ribs and stuffed portabellos were where it was at, for sure. We enjoyed a specialty drink each visit, as well. The fairy floss, aka cotton candy, was divine.  I never thought I'd like cotton candy so much. It actually had strawberry flavor so that was fun! And way to represent Tam Tams in the form of a shake. YUM",
            "Good service. Great food.  Had luscious tender ribs and salad.",
            "Even on a very busy Saturday night, the staff was exceptionally friendly and polite.  Genuine smiles and great interaction - not too overbearing...  just perfect. They sat me right away, also taking time to answer questions about the menu and make suggestions...  I never felt as though my questions were a bother or that I was being rushed to decide.  The food was reasonably priced, came out fast and tasted great.  I ordered the 300g sirloin with mashed potatoes and a cob of corn.  The steak was perfectly cooked (medium) and the corn on the cob was surprisingly tender - delicious!  I highly recommend this location (Darling Harbour/Harbourside Shopping Center)."

We had two appetizers (Australian word is 'entrees') and two mains. The beef pancake rolls were perfectly seasoned and delicious. Chicken wontons were also yum with a not-too spicy sauce. The mapo tofu was not too oily and had a sweet-ish spicy sauce. It was the perfect  amount for three people.   Prices were remarkably reasonable, servers friendly and attentive.

This place is truly a hidden gem and I don't want to give it a good review in case it Becomes too popular and we can't get back in but they deserve the praise. We had the 6 entrees and 4 mains banquet. We picked half the dishes and left it up to the waitress to pick the rest. Good decision, her selections were better than ours, especially the beef in pancakes, yum yum. When we were leaving the manager personally asked us how we enjoyed the food and thanked us for coming. It may not have the harbour view but the food was amazing",

My favourites were the salt and pepper soft shell crab, sliced pork belly, basa fillets, stuffed tofu with mince, steamed snapper and the rib eye.  Muriel was a great host and we all enjoyed the food immensely and wondered why it took us so long to visit this place."

            "Awesome Malaysian restaurant!  If you've read other reviews below, there's a good reason why YouTubers (including myself) rave about this place: possibly hands down the best Malay restaurant in all of Sydney. Located across the street from Market City in Chinatown.  I only tried the Laksa Hainan Chicken so the food component of this review is only based on that dish. Who knew that 2 of my favorite Malay dishes can create so much synergy - it's like a matchmade in heaven! The noodles are a combo of the rice vermicelli and thicker yellow noodles. Broth is solid - good kick but not spicy at all, so even people who can't handle spice can eat this dish; yet, there's a complex umami flavor that's reminiscent of OG laksa with the coconut milk element. The Hainanese chicken is tender and just oh-so-good. You may be wondering how the dish is not the same without the various sauces that comes with its standard rice counterpart (usually ginger scallion, sambal, and a soy sauce-based sauce), but with the flavoring of this dish, it's not needed.  Total price for Laksa Hainan Chicken was a little less than $18 USD.  Ambience inside is wonderful and the decor makes you feel like you're back in SE Asia getting street food. Staff were also friendly, and service was fairly quick. Try this place out whenever you are visiting down under!",
            "Found this place watching Youtube foodies. This is our first time eating Malaysian food. So we went here because it was recommended by many YouTubers. Make a reservation (aka booking). They get busy. If you want to walk in, get there before 5pm as it gets really busy after.  Started with the Roti with Satay chicken. Nice crispy outside and yummy chicken inside. It came with a sauce which made it tastier.  Get the Laksa! Oh so good. Got it with Hainan Chicken. Chicken was soft. Broth was hearty with nice spicy coconut flavor.  Staff was very friendly and explained some of the dishes. Once you're done eating, pay at the front desk. Fast and efficient."

Every course was well thought of, in terms of flavour combination and plating). Like a lot of fellow yelpers, my favourite courses include:  Goat cheese churros - who would thought that goat cheese will go with churros!   Duck & rabbit rillette - both meat shine through and the pickled pear completes the dish as it's refreshing and light. Just wish there were more brioche.   Brussels sprouts (side) - O.M.G , I bet they put a lot of butter in this but it is doesnt matter. Worth every calorie!   I can go on and on on how good every dish I had was sooooo good (except for lettuce salad [side], that was really sloppy, and tasted blend) . YOU YOU YOU just need to try it for yourself.  Even though this restaurant is pretty big, I'm sure it's pretty packed everyday, so make sure you make an advanced reservation so you wont be disappointed.  Great place for a date/ friends gathering/ special occasion celebration  !",

Felt welcomed, even as a solo diner. Staff were knowlegable and engaging to the point of advising me that perhaps my eyes were bigger than my tum when I attempted to order two sides with my main. I like to think they are acting responsibly and not wanting to throw left over food away. But in reality, it meant I could order dessert. Win-win!

I decided on the mixed sashimi don along with a serving of the teriyaki salmon to share. The salmon was delicious if a little sickly with the thick sauce, but the freshness of the sashimi helped compliment this, combining into one fine meal!   The service was prompt but not rushed which I always appreciate if I'm not settling in for a marathon meal. I'm all for trying different places, but this place will definitely be getting a visit from me again. Lucky them!",

            "Jang Ta Bal is ONE OF THE BEST Korean BBQ spots I've ever been to! I wish they had a location in Florida. The charcoal cooking method gives a great taste as opposed to some of the more common electric burners. Don't let the entry fool you, you'll have to take the elevator up to the second floor to access this restaurant.  Once you reach the second floor you'll be greeted by the friendly staff who will  seat you immediately. While you progress to your table you'll pass by a showcase of varied meats a lot of which is Wagyu! The displays were clean and well organized surely to amp up your appetite. In a glass room you'll notice one of the chefs operating a meat slicer as the meat is cut fresh upon ordering. As I'm sure some of you Korean BBQ fanatics have experienced some restaurants have pre portioned frozen meats. Don't skimp out on this restaurant, the food quality is high so make the most of it!  While honeymooning in Sydney my wife and I were on the hunt for \"Yangnyeom Gejang\". Neither my wife nor I are Korean but \"Yangnyeom Gejang\" is Spicy Marinated Raw Crab. If you've never tried it and are open minded seriously give it a try as its not readily available. The crab dish was extremely well portioned and makes for a great side dish/appetizer. The banchan was superb and you'll be offered a variety of side dishes to accompany your meal.   Aside from the raw crab we ordered Wagyu Beef Tongue, Galbi, and Pork belly! All of which satisfied us and we were well satiated! Whether you're just visiting or a local resident I HIGHLY recommend Jang Ta Bal for your next Korean BBQ venture!",
            "We love a good Korean BBQ and it is of our opinion that Jang Ta Bal is honestly one of the best we've tried in Sydney. We know this restaurant is super famous in Strathfield with lines every day and we can see why! We're lucky to now find this restaurant on our own doorsteps in Sydney City. Their use of premium high quality meats is superb and we loved our dining experience here.Located not far from the CBD in walking distance from Central Station or Town Hall, you'll find an entrance to the restaurant, lit by a neon light projection of the restaurants name pointing you to the door and elevator going up to Jang Ta Bal BBQ on the first floor. As you enter the lobby, you're met with some wall art showcasing the use of the cow in all the different meats cuts. In a glass display is some high quality Wagyu ready to be cut to order.We make our way into the restaurant to the table near the windows and sit at a table of four around the bench top grill, where you cook your meat over hot coals. The service is impeccable and staff regularly attend to us and change the grill top after we've cooked the beef and before the pork.Since we couldn't decide on the meats, we had BBQ beef set including Marinated Beef Ribs & Wagyu Intercostal & Wagyu Scotch Fillet. $69We also shared the BBQ pork set with Fresh Pork Belly & Soy Marinated Pork Rib & Pork Shoulder Loin. $59 for this platter.It came with mini bowls of additions (banchan) to have with our meats including salad, onion, pickled vegetable, shredded spring onion and more. They replenish these if you wish, though with so much food, we doubt it's necessary.There are a range of side accompaniments, in particular the Seafood and Shallot Pancake for $16. A huge serving fills the plate and the pancake is filled with calamari pieces and shallots.Although you might find the Super Spicy Cheese Pork Ribs expensive at $40, these were a highlight of our meal. They had us licking our fingers clean after pulling the ribs and their cheesy goodness. Don't fret, they're not too hot if you don't want, you can get mild or hot, the sauce was so good, they should bottle it. We simply could not get enough, oh so bad, but oh so good! Perfect to enjoy with a few beers and a few mates.We also loved the egg soup, a hot bowl of scrambled egg which was super creamy.The doen Jang Jji gae or Soybean paste stew with mixed seafood & tofu was also a tasty choice.The Bibimbap is always a must when visiting a Korean restaurant. A large serving consisting of rice, carrot, cucumber, bean sprouts and topped with a fried egg.We can see why Jang Ta Bal is so popular, this casual eatery offers up large servings of delicious quality ingredients and has great service too. If the Strathfield restaurant is too busy, we recommend paying their city location a visit"

Glad we walked in, as the tapas was amazing! Everything on the menu was $10 - no exceptions, and the range was great. The staff were super friendly and helpful, the service was great, and when we got our dishes, they were pretty amazing! The restaurant had a really nice decor, and was sort of Spanish gothic in style. Had some lovely sangria to accompany the food. Would definitely drop in again if next time I was in Sydney :) Muy bueno!"

            "What the heck! So glad we found this place... has underground secret eatery vibes. We did the \"trust us\" and we did not steer wrong. The meal was outstanding from the tar tar to the corn ribs to the fried rice... Wish I could say I will be back soon but a trip across the world will not allow! Check this spot out!",
            "What a neat find tucked away in an alley. Feels divey from the get-go with neon lights, Japanese scribbled on the walls, and moody pictures against black walls. All while playing classic punk rock from the 90s lol. Just eclectic, if you're looking for a little fun/different.  We were recommended a few dishes and they were seriously on point. Started with the cream cheese stuffed jalape\u00f1os. Nice spicy kick. Deep fried in light Japanese panko. Also got the pork hock, which was absolutely delicious. Nice and crispy with a juicy meaty center. Flavors were spot on. Topped with shaved green apples and caramel. So good!  Wife got the miso chicken, which was nice and juicy. Lightly flavored with a miso sauce. Topped with steamed zucchini and greens.   Overall great experience. Service was super attentive and helpful. Check this place out!",
            "This place was busy for a Monday night! Came in to sample their new spring menu.   To start we had the corn sticky ribs, the Charred octopus okonomiyaki, the Barbequed king prawns yakitori and the Pulled pork bao.   From the raw section we had the kingfish ceviche and the Wagyu beef tartar. The Tartar was by far a better dish and so tasty!  For mains we had the Sake miso chicken with a side of the Japanese fried rice with pork and the Crispy Lotus chips. Holy moly the chicken is so tender and had a really lovely sweet burdock sauce!  To finish we had the Yukari infused pineapple sashimi, granita, liquorice parfait and the Milk chocolate jelly. The Yukari had such a refreshing finish. The chocolate jelly had more a thicker texture and looked like caramel (i thought it would come out clear)   Wow! We had a lovely feast and I am loving the 90's Nirvana vibe."

            "Very nice little spot with some great HappyHour specials. I liked sitting outside and watching the people go by. Pretty ambiance, easy ordering system, and friendly service.",
            "I went to Fratelli Fresh for dinner after noticing the all-you-can-eat pizza/pasta deal for $25 for Sunday night. The catch was that you also had to buy a drink, which were typically around $15-20. I ordered the Hawaiian pizza first, which was pretty good. I then got the Rigatoni, which had lamb in it. It was decent pasta and the lamb was a nice addition, though I wish there had been more lamb and the lamb was more flavorful. I got the Lychee Bella as my drink, which didn't actually have much of a lychee flavor and didn't taste that fruity.  The service speed was a bit slow and confusing, since the employees were running around the place getting pizza from one area and pasta from another and bringing them to the tables in addition to taking orders. This restaurant has a nice clean appearance and is situated near a few other Italian places in a partially outdoor market kind of setting. There is plenty of seating, including outdoor seating.  Overall, I would recommend Fratelli Fresh if you are interested in eating a lot of decent quality pizza or pasta. If so, then head on over on Sunday night, and be sure to stuff yourself with as much food as possible to take advantage of the all-you-can-eat deal.",
            "Ok this place is lucky that the food is delicious because man their service is terrible. It was entirely chaotic with servers taking on multiple roles without any semblance of knowing what to do. One minute a woman is serving me one of the dishes I ordered, the next im requesting dessert from her at the gelato counter. I mean this is anything but a tightly run ship. I also find the ordering part strange. You can grab a table but then you go into the restaurant to place your order at any number of counters...drinks, dessert, food. Your drink is given to you at the counter but you get a gps buzzer for the waiters to bring your food. Why not just have regular waiter service?   I ordered the roast pumpkin which was super delicious. I also had the burrata because I can never resist that refreshing cheese and it was served with luscious summer strawberries, beats, and pistachios. And finally I had the side of Brussels sprouts, another thing I can never say no to. They were all wonderful, which has to be this place's saving grace.  There was an instagram promotion for free dessert with purchase of a main course. I initially asked the woman when I was buying drinks what I need to show to prove I had bought a main and she said just to show the instagram post. I ran out of patience trying to explain my question. And honestly the dessert waitress didn't even bother to check if I had purchased a main, so there ya go. But she was clearly frazzled because when she was filling my cannoli she put in the wrong filling (still delicious). I have to think that it's because she's probably thinking about the 500 other jobs she has to do that night! The parents in front of me also bought a dessert for their birthday kid and it languished on the counter with an unlit sparkler as all of the people she asked to deliver it to the table nodded in agreement and then simply walked away forgetting about their duty.  I really hope management can create some order here because it really could be Sydney's answer to Eataly but they have a long way to go!"

            "If you have a list of \"Restaurants to Try Before You Die\" then make sure this is in your top 10. I waited a very long time to try this place, but last November we had a special occasion and it was finally time. We booked in for a Saturday lunch and spent a good 4 1/2 hours here... to say it did not disappoint is an understatement.  The food includes some of the most beautiful and innovative preparations I have ever seen anywhere. The pork broth is divine and if you are very lucky you might even get a tour of the kitchen. And the service was absolutely the best service I've ever had at any of the top restaurants I've been to while living in Australia the past 10+ years. Exceptional.   Finally, the view... I mean, C'mon. Gorgeous harbor view of the Sydney Opera House, the bridge, all of it. It will cost you the equivalent of a month's food budget, but it is definitely worth it.",
            "How ironic. Our day was spent hiking all around the harbour, and this evening we reserved a window view of all the places where we stopped to catch our breath. Ha! The panoramic view from our table was awesome -- God couldn't have made a better view if He tried. Katie's BFF and her FWB took us here for a couples date night out. The girls dressed in skimpy cocktail dresses, while Noah and I dressed in slightly slimmed-down versions of a tuxedo. Quay Sydney is one of the most expensive restaurants in town with an eight-course menu starting at $350 (AUD), and a \"Benchmark Wine Pairing\" for a cool $1,100 (AUD). Chef Peter Gilmore and Noah are friends, so tonight became a very special foursome dining experience. We started off with a bottle of Scotch -- the Talisker 40yo Bodega Series -- and paired it with pan-seared ribeye strips. The eight-course meal was a mix of all that is wild about this continent: raw sea scallops, Oscietra caviar, chamomile broth, bone marrow noodles, roasted duck with Morello cherries and black garlic, confit pig jowl, and prunes covered in dark chocolate. Eroticism for your mouth. As for the wine pairing, see below for some of the bottles we consumed (not in any particular order):  *2008 Mount Difficulty Pinot Noir, Central Otago, New Zealand *2021 Best's Young Vine Meunier, Great Western, Victoria, Australia  *2004 Ch\u00e2teau Mont-Redon Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape Grenache blend, Rh\u00f4ne Valley, France *1964 Henriques & Henriques Sercial Madeira Garrafeira, Madeira, Portugal  *2021 Robert Weil Trocken Riesling, Rheingau, Germany *2020 Andr\u00e9 Perret Coteau de Chery Viognier, Condrieu, France *2021 Lake Folly Chardonnay, New South Wales, Australia  *2017 Domaine Simha Beauregard Pinot Noir, Tasmania, Australia  *2018 Jean Grivot Vosne-Romanee, Burgundy, France  *2018 Massolino Barolo, Piemonte, Italy   Not that we had any room for it, but Chef Gilmore insisted we try his specialty dessert: \"the moment in time.\" Which, of course, he made personally. The desert was rushed to our table, then the magic happened. You're actually tasting the chocolate in a really pure form, and you think it would be heavy, but it's actually really light. It almost looks like a sponge cake, but it's lighter than air, and with the warmth of your mouth, the chocolate virtually disappears and leaves this beautiful chocolate essence in your mouth. It's perhaps one of the beautiful contradictions of the desert, that so much time, energy, and chocolate could be expended in pursuit of a single, perfect, ephemeral moment. It was a gastronomic orgasm to be sure -- like, OMG!!  At 2AM we finally said goodnight to Chef Gilmore. Thank God we had hired a limousine that evening... but we should have also hired a forklift. LOL.   Quay Sydney defines fine-dining in Australia. It's worth your time and your wallet. Say, \"bucket list.\"",
            "Yummy yummy yummy.. One of the best meals I had while in Sydney. Chef Peter Gilmore and Quay made the list for \"five years on the World's 50 Best Restaurant list and held the title of Best Restaurant in Australia for three of those years\".  Located right across from the Sydney Opera House in the Rocks and next to the Sydney Harbor Bridge, the restaurant is in the heart of the harbor.  It's located on the 4th floor of the boat terminal, giving you an amazing view as you dine.  We were looking directly out the window at the Harbor Bridge itself, lit up in all of its glory on a clear spring night.  The service at Quay is impeccable, everything you expect of a high end restaurant.  The food brought out and presented to you at the same time - the details matter.  This restaurant only offers a 6 course or a 10 course tasting menu, and everyone at the table must select the same number of courses - which left a lot to decide if you can't agree.  But after the decisions are made, sit back and relax and leave everything up to Chef Gilmore and his team.  We opted for the 6 course menu and here's what it looked like:  *Amuse Bouche - unfortunately I can't remember what the tart consisted of but it was rich and delicious!  Please serve this as part of your menu!   *Hand Harvested Seafood with Virgin Soy, Seaweed, and Aged Vinegar - the seafood comes in a bowl that looks like a crustacean.  They give you tweezers so you can hand stack each bite with every single element to give you a burst of flavors as you take in each bite.  The squid/octopus tentacles with the other elements (I can't even begin to tell you what everything is) is bursting with flavor and paired together so perfectly! 5/5  *Osetra Caviar with Smoked Eel, Walnuts and Sea Cucumber Crackling - this is another dish that plays with flavor and textures.  The crackling sea cucumber is nothing I've ever tasted before and adds so much to the smoked eel mousse and caviar.  Lovely, rich, but elegant. 5/5  *Steamed Mud Crab Custard with Garden & Sea Greens - You pour the dashi over the mixture and it's a burst of flavors in your mouth.  I didn't notice any mud crab but the custard had amazing flavors mixed with the garden and sea greens. 5/5  *Salmon Roe and Butter on a Crumpet - we were surprised with an additional course of salmon roe and butter on a crumpet off menu.  The crumpet was soft but toasted on on side.  The butter and salmon roe made it taste like a salmon cream cheese bagel, but of course more elegant and refined.  My least favorite dish of the night because it wasn't as amazing as the other dishes. 3/5  *Bone Marrow Pasta with White Asparagus, Koji and Garum Butter - It had good flavors but I was expecting more when I read bone marrow pasta.  The pasta was cooked well but it wasn't as extravagant as the other dishes presented. 4/5  *Smoked Pig Jowl with Black Lipped Abalone, Shiitake and Fan Shell Clams - that pig jowl definitely melts in your mouth cause of all that fat.  It was delicious and tasted fantastic.  I was hoping being the main course, you would get more than 1-2 bites but the dish was as small as the other courses. Amazing texture, melts in your mouth like butter, delicious flavors. 5/5  *You get to choose your main dish, between 2 options - the pork jowl or the roasted Maremma duck.  Nobody got the duck so we didn't get to try this dish.  For dessert, you get to choose between the White Coral or the Moo.  I chose the Moo and quickly realized why they named it that - just look at that bowl, it was made perfectly for this dessert.  Rich, sweet, decadent and chocolatey.  Delicious dessert.  The White Coral was a bit on the lighter side - coconut, some kind of fruit reduction in the middle.  I hear my Moo was better according to a friend.  And if you aren't full from dinner, they surprise you with some canneles and honey tarts after dinner and you leave with a memorabilia of the menu and some Valrhona chocolates in a cute little box.  They sure do think of everything!  The details, the plating, the actual plates, the service and the food makes this place an amazing addition and a lovely treat for those visiting Sydney!"

            "What a hidden gem! This cute restaurant is located right next to Darling Harbour but away from all the tourist traps. We find a voucher on Groupon and decided to try it out.   Once inside we checked in for our reservation and were seated immediately. We ordered a mock-tail and well as a cocktail. Both were very tasty and brought out fairly fast.  For our entrees (appetizers) we ordered the escargot and the mushroom leek crepe. The crepe I didn't try however my partner seemed to love it. However the escargot was PHENOMENAL! Such a delicious amount of garlic which you can dip the two pieces of bread afterwords in to make your own garlic break...thank me later ;)  For our mains I ordered the duck while my partner ordered beef. Both dishes were presented beautifully and were accompanied by a delicious sauce and side. My favorite part of the duck was the crispy skin which was seasoned so wonderfully.   For dessert we both goth the sticky date pudding. With every bite we were impressed. The dessert was sweet but not overly sweet. The ice cream adds the perfect touch.  Definitely recommend this place and I hope to be back soon!",
            "Pretentious. Nice view. Classy.    Calamari was the highlight.  Firm not chewy. Thick cut.  Delicious in the sauce.   The escargot was very buttery, cooked well. However I have had better.   Pate was plentiful.  Too much we couldn't eat it all. Great flavor. Requested extra bread.    The veal was so good!   Topped with a creamy mushroom sauce, enough to cover every nite.  Very rich.  Meat was tender.   This is the type of establishment that waits till you've finished your course before they move on to the next.  Be sure to tell your server you are ready if your plates still appear to be full. The server had a French accent. There was conversation amongst the table if it was real or not lol.  I believe it was, and really did add to the authenticity of the restaurant.",
            "Exceptional little restaurant in a convenient location.   A short walk away from the Convention light rail station and The Harbourside mall, the Little Snail offers 3-course lunch and dinner options. The menu is distinctly French with an Australian twist, and an extensive wine list to match.   The calamari was delicious, tender and crispy. The veal and the lamb were also great options.   The portions are quite generous and the 3 courses are plenty to fill up hungry adults."

Being a regular drinker at the Forresters I decided it was time to check out the new place upstairs and see what all the fuss was about.   Queenie's is Carribean/Jamaican food - and good lord it is AMAZING.   We tried the Pork Bammies, which were OK. I would recommend skipping them and going straight for the BBQ Jerk Corn. \"WTF?\" I hear you say. Just you wait and see. The Cervice is great and the Jerk Chicken with Jungle Slaw is to die for. Do I seem over the top with my praise? I haven't even gotten to the glory of the doughnuts yet!!  Do yourself a favour and check this place out. Share the plates with friends. And hey, it's actually cheaper to drink the beers up at Queenie's than downstairse in the bar... go figure.",
            "What do you do when your friend just came back from a month long holiday through South America and the Caribbean, and telling you stories of great adventure and all the amazing food she enjoyed? You visit Queenie's of course!  The entrance to this place is not easy to spot. You need to go through The Forrester then take the colourful stairs that will lead you to Queenie's.  Since it's my first experiencing Caribbean food, I was overwhelmed with choices. The waitress noticed and asked, \"Is it your first time here?\" To which I replied, \"Yes.\" She recommended the Half and Half where you'd get Jerk Chicken, Jerk Ribs, 2 Grilled Corn, Sweet Potato Fries and Island Slaw. Tender chicken, fall of the bone ribs, grilled corn on the cob covered with shredded coconut and tasty sweet potato fries. Delicious!  We also ordered the Voodoo Chicken Wings. Comes with cooling coconut dipping sauce, the chicken wings were deep fried goodness covered in tasty hot sauce. It was finger-lickin', mouth-smackin' good!  The staff were warm and attentive. And do try their cocktails. I tried the Kraken & Fresh Apple, it was sweet and refreshing with freshly squeezed apple juice. I left feeling slightly more cultured and I can nod to my friend's Caribbean holiday stories with the feeling that I'd been there too or at least tasted some of it!",
            "We came here for date night on a Friday and we were seated next to a dingy red light - well, the entire place has this dodgy red glow! Sets the mood I suppose.   We shared the Puerto Rican avocado and plantains, which is basically an avo dip with plantain chips. A great starter so no complaints here. I also ordered the ceviche for $18 that you can view in the photos - I absolutely LOVE ceviche, because it's so hard to do it well. Sadly, while I was happy with the rest of the food, the ceviche was a sore disappointment. Stay away from the ceviche! You can barely taste the scallops and they're served on weird delicate chips. Not the ceviche cured in a bed of lime juice that I'm used to. Finally, the chicken and ribs were amazing. Next time, we'll order more chicken and ribs and no ceviche. Definitely worth a second visit!"

Really bland and expensive at $29. x Salmon- this was more flavoursome but still not amazing for $29. x Lychee cocktail- delicious and refreshing! Not too sweet, just perfect and only $8. x Coffee cocktail- this was also another delight though I preferred the lychee."

            "The best meal we had in sydney!! We did the $65 menu based on the other reviews saying the $80 one was so much food. The $65 was perfect. We were full but not so full.   We loved every single course - olives were unique and different sizes and flavors. The bread and hummus was great. My husband loved the hummus because it had a smoke flavor to it. One of my favorites was the polenta and cabbage mousse- so rich and slightly sweet. The cold cuts were fresh and amazing- my favorite was the salami. Great strong flavor! The chorizo with white beans was different but yummy and the perfect amount since it was quite rich. The chef meat selection was so great.. the crisp on the pork was delicious. It was cooked perfectly and the sauce with it was light and complimented the flavor nicely. Lastly, the dessert was one of the best I have ever had- the chocolate with the raspberry and pistachio was the perfect combination. I could eat it every day!   Service was good and helpful with our wine selections, brought me a taster so I could be sure to decide on the right one.   The restaurant is hidden in an alley so might be hard to find. They were also closed on Anzac Day so we missed dining with them on the first night we tried, so just know they may be closed on all holidays.   For the price and amount of food, I think it was one of the best deals we had and like I said, best tasting of anything we had so a great choice! Don't miss dining here!",
            "I made a reservation for Saturday night dinner at Mercado over a week in advance. It turned out to be a great choice - the restaurant was only a 3 minute walk from our hotel and adjacent to the club we wanted to go to that evening.  There were many tapas options on the a la carte menu and also two set menus to choose from (A$65 and A$80). My eyes were hungrier than my stomach and we ended up going up with the A$80 menu. My tip would be to go with the A$65 menu instead. In terms of quantity, we really did not need the Roasted Prawns, extra veggie side with the meat, and a second dessert.  Everything from start to finish was delicious. I like that Mercado groups dishes to serve several at a time. The Fish 'n Chips is a fish based dip served with potato chips, which is of course, total different than what I expected. The Jersey Milk Ricotta appetizers served with Truffle Honey was divine. This is the one item not on the A$65 menu that I would've really missed. The Truffle Mortadella was expertly made and the slices were beautiful.  The next set were larger \"appetizers\" including the famous Pumpkin Ravioli (as excellent as everyone claims), BBQ Chorizo (I was already starting to feel full at this point), and the Roasted Prawns (perhaps one of the weakest dishes of the evening).  At this point, our meat course came out. You can choose anything in the meat portion of the regular menu and we chose Spit Roasted Wagyu Beef Short Rib. It was a bit on the fatty side but fat is flavor and I really liked it. The spices and texture of the Roasted Carrots paired well with the short rib.  We were so stuffed but we're not quitters and still had two desserts to go. Both desserts were on the rich side. The Bread Pudding was beautifully presented in a small cast iron skillet and a vanilla sauce was poured on at the table. This is one of the best bread puddings I've ever had. The other dessert was Dulce De Leche Ice Cream with butterscotch. The dinner lasted two hours and we were one of the last tables still dining at the end of the evening. The food was really spectacular!",
            "Fan frigging tactic.   Threw caution to the wind and let the chef send a selection of dishes our way. In short, each was on point with some creative touches here and there.   The Turkish Ravioli with wood fired pumpkin was a standout, and I appreciated that I could actually taste the pumpkin.   The Brussels sprouts were delightful, with great smokey notes.   And the pork bellies. Amazing. Crispy skin with melt-in-your mouth smoothness just beneath. Their house pepper hot sauce added some nice heat if you're looking for some heat.   And dessert. The rosewater trifle was surprisingly good -- something I would not have selected on my own. But the rose tastes were subtle (no soap-sucking taste) and the pastry layers flaky.  My favourite was the dulce de leche ice cream with maple bacon \"candle\" and warm butterscotch sauce. Salty sweet goodness that harkened back to the chef's other passion -- the Good Times ice cream shop down the road."

The food was wonderful but when the lightning, music, decor and staff are all just as lovely it's hard to find anything wrong. I personally love a tasting menu as I'm pretty adventurous but I definitely don't recommend taking a \"modifier\" or picky eater. I enjoyed both the red wines I tried but their \"by the glass\" selection is quite small. I hope this place will be around the next time we make it to Sydney!"

            "Opened only 5 days ago, this is the second branch of Hana Hana which is located where French Riviera was previously. The ordering process and the menu is the same as in the first Hana Hana, so nothing special to talk about here.  But what I want to talk about is the new Hana Hana cafe on the second floor. The menu has a lot of choices which you wouldn't normally find in a cafe in Sydney such as Japanese style parfait, kakigori which is a Japanese shaved ice dessert, roll cake, ice cream, pancake and different choices of drinks. \\(^_^)/\\(^_^)/  As a regular at the first Hana Hana, I wanted to try the new cafe so I went with 2 of my friends. I must say, the interior looks nice, better than a lot of other cafes around the city and you can sit outside if you wanted. Once inside, my friends got the hot black sesame latte and I got the ice green tea latte which I usually get when I go to a cafe in Sydney. The ice green tea latte came with a scoop of green tea ice cream which I think is a plus but it came in a tall and slim glass which wasn't practical. The straw and the spoon I was given was just long enough to fit the glass so that wasn't so good. The hot black sesame latte came in mugs which was kind of small considering it was the regular size but looks good.  The taste of the ice green tea latte was good, similar to other cafes but a little different and I liked how the green tea ice cream melts and blends with the drink. My friends said that the hot black sesame latte was good and considering not many places have this drink, it was great.   I haven't tried the other choices on the menu but having tried the ice green tea latte and saw some of the desserts being made, I would be coming back as the prices are cheap for the drinks/food/sweets and also the interior looks great. \\(^O^)/",
            "The restaurant is absolutely cozy and laid back with great food. It's a Japanese BBQ place with fresh prepared meat and mushrooms which is very well nitration balanced."

            "A MUST HAVE when you are having fun at Darling Harbour. Stop by and have a quick lunch! This should replace your once in a while maccas to once in a while Betty's Burger. Superior fast food chain in every way!  Service: 4.5 / 5 stars Vibe: 4.5 / 5 stars Food: 4.5 / 5 stars  Usually the service is fantastic here but once in a while, you get questionable service. You are greeted with a Hello and Goodbye as if you are welcome whenever. The vibe in Betty's Burger suits the beachy theme and I'm a huge fan of it especially this bang on spot in Darling Harbour. Could be improved trying to ward off seagulls in anyway as they like to scramble for some leftovers once in a while.  I loooveeeee the onion rings here. Worth coming here for the onion rings. Betty's Classic or Betty's Deluxe are my favourites. The Supreme Chicken is alright. Maybe it's just not for me but the chips are questionable at times. They are overburnt or have black markings on them at the bottom sometimes. I would just get the onion rings over the chips.  All in all, I love this place and always come here for a quick lunch or quick dinner when I'm playing ping pong near the area.",
            "Yes Betty! During my last trip to Sydney we made it out to Betty's Burgers and for some reason I chose to be a vegetarian that night and you know what... I am so glad because their fried mushroom burger is super freaking delicious.   Listen I don't know how much you really want me to say aside from the fact the burgers are delicious, the fries are delicious and even though I didn't have a shake, I saw that my friends were really enjoying their's. If I wasn't on another continent at the moment, I would be eating Betty's Burgers on the regular. Whether you live in Sydney or visiting Sydney, do yourself a favor and go get yourself a burger from Betty!",
            "Having been to 2 of the Queensland locations I had hopes, however sometimes things get left behind when branching out.  We visited on a busy Saturday day with the wife & baby. We were promptly showed to a table which they had prepared with enough room for the pram. Nice airy, location outside the ICC Exhibition Centre & just opposite the park.  The food was great, juicy burgers with cloud soft buns, fresh lettuce & tomato. Chips were hot & crispy, and the garlic mayo dipping sauce is too damn good! The only minor issue we had was there were a couple of items that weren't brought out. However  the staff were quick & attentive and promptly resolved this on the spot. To make up for any inconvenience, they even gave us a free concrete (like a sundae but better).  All in all, I'm impressed with this Sydney location, the burgers are up there with the best of Sydney, the staff are friendly and great to see they have high standards in customer service.  Looking forward to when their Manly store opens up in the new future, a bit closer to home & out of the hustle & hustle of Darling Harbour."

Grilled pork rice bowl, crab omelette served on a grilled croissant, or mushroom risotto just to name a few.   The staff were as attentive as possible considering how busy they were with takeaway orders and diners in alike. I had the grilled pork rice bowl, which I found to be delicious especially with the dressing that came with. Despite my dislike of pink radishes, it was flavoursome to say the least and the pork was really of melt-in-your-mouth quality.   The coffee led a lot to be desired, i found my mocha to be bitter sweet more than anything else and just a little lacklustre.

They were busy and it took 15 minutes, but the staff were super friendly and considerate. Called us when the table was ready. Kids were happy playing. I got the Eggs Benedict with shredded pork and my wife got the Risotto. Both were absolutely incredible. Lots of flavor and hit the spot. Risotto was super rich with mushroom and truffles. Kids even wanted a second meal so we got scrambled eggs, toasted brioche, and a side of avocado. I realize that kid orders are complicated (because they are so boring and simple) and they were very receptive.   Coffee was good (4 starts) but not the best I've had. Didn't matter we were so happy with everything else it was a great experience. Can't wait to come back, won't even have to go to Pancakes on the Rocks first, which is awesome."

            "Dined here twice right inside the Harbourside at Darling Harbour. Enjoyed their Roti filled with egg. Curried chicken with rice and beef rendang with rice. Second time visit, we ordered half of Hainese chicken with coconut rice and chicken rice. It came with two bowls of chicken soup. Go try this place if you're looking for something different - Malaysian cuisine!",
            "My wife and I first had their lunch special.  It was great!  I had the beef curry and my wife had the noodles with beef.  It was delicious.  You could taste the balanced spices.  We loved the food so much my wife and I went back for dinner two days later.  We had their Banquet special which consisted of their Lamb, whole fish, Beef and Malaysian fried rice.  All of the dishes were tasty and well prepared.  We were on vacation from Hawaii and both agreed the Malaysian dishes brought back memories when Oahu (Hawaii) used to have a Malaysian restaurant which no longer exist (Oahu).  The server was very helpful and made sure we had what we needed at our table."

            "Located in the new and renovated market city, YAYOI is a clear stand out. With a beautiful furnished space and plenty of seating, this is our new favourite Japanese restaurant.   We tried the Yayoi Gozen - this is the perfect dishes to try all of Yayoi favourites which includes the pork loin cutlet, salmon salad, salmon teriyaki and the Wagyu sukiyaki.  We love how Yayoi continues the traditional of meals consisting of one soup dish and three other dishes providing a good balance of nutrients which is believed in japan to be the foundation of a healthy diet.   We also had the delicious Unagi Hitsumabushi Teishoku. Ellen's first time trying unagi couldn't have been better with this dish! The kinme-mai rice used has 10% fewer calories than the other rice used so you have more room for dessert.  Now of course- to the dessert , we recommend the matcha warabi mocha and the matcha anmitsu. This is the perfect finish to a well balanced meal leaving you satisified.",
            "Amazing Japanese food with some high-tech flair! I came here with 2 other friends around 8pm, and we were able to be seated immediately. A cool aspect of this restaurant is that you order on ipads, which is a pretty cool touch that is different than other restaurants. Since I am a sucker for some good salmon sashimi, I got the raw salmon sashimi don, which comes with miso soup. The salmon is on top of a bowl of rice with shredded tamago and seaweed. The salmon was fresh and buttery, and the whole dish was satisfying and delicious! I would definitely come back to try their other dishes!",
            "Nice place to hang out with friends. Food was very delicious and price was surprisingly not expensive! We went on thurs at 6 and only had to wait for 15 mins for a table for 4. They have really good services and we ordered everything on the computer. The food that amazed me was the dessert, not so sweet and sticky. Though i will not compare the food with the top japanese ones, i'd say this restaurant is good enough for casual japanese dinner.  We finished our dinner around 8pm and there was still a long queue waiting outside, couldnt imagine how popular it is!  I will definitely go back again with my family again."

We reserved our lunch ahead of time. We had two hours to drink whatever we wanted. We ordered the wings small size as an entree(appetizer) and got it half spicy and half their house sauce. These wings were delicious. The spicy sauce is a Franks red hot sauce and the house sauce was a teriyaki flavored kind of sauce. Not sure what the dipping sauce was but it was so good!   My fianc\u00e9 and I ordered the steak with salad and both got mashed potatoes with red wine jus. It was sooooo good! The steak was perfectly cooked to medium rare, so flavorful and paired well with the creamy mashed potatoes! You go up to the counter/ bar to order which made everything easy.   I definitely recommend this place!",
            "I'm the type who likes the pub on a weekday night or a weekend afternoon. It's nice to have some folks around, but I prefer having space to move and relax. For that reason, Hart's Pub was perfect for me.   We stopped by around lunch time and I tried several beers. I liked each to varying degrees, but between their descriptive menu and the helpful barkeep, I knew what I was getting into each time.   The food is nice as well. We tried a few of their shared plates, and all were quite good.   The facility itself is spread amongst three levels. You just walk in and find space on your own, then order from the bar. There were only a few tables available during the afternoon, so if you absolutely want a seat, you may want to reserve ahead. Like a proper pub, however, the tables are spaced well apart, so there is ample standing room for those who just want a beer.   Overall, a very nice and unassuming pub."

Whirlybird recently turned one and we learnt that they can also throw one hell of a party. Their large Cabaret styled venue accomodating a large crowd embracing the celebration.  With a large number of people congregating around the bar, the bar tenders were on point keeping up with demand. Their fully stocked bar busily pumping out a range of beer, wine, champagne and a range of quality cocktails.   There was also some incredible chicken to nibble on, served with some tasty sides. There was a disappearing act with the mini burger pyramid stacks. They were crazy popular, now you see em and now you don't.  The food and drinks were perfect for this party, allowing you to take in the entertainment and socialise. There were plenty of food and lifestyle folk enjoying what the evening had to offer. The entertainment was going off, the band did a good job to engage the punters. Having said that they were upstaged by the Burlesque performance, the ladies putting on a classy striptease that drew the crowd in with a magnetic like pull. Good news - the venue transforms into the Birdcage on a Saturday night, with an adult's only evening filled with fun, food, booze and burlesque."

Darling Harbour was my absolute favorite part of Sydney, hands down, and this restaurant is a go-to that I wouldn't skip.   We kept seeing \"Bugs\" on the menu and wanted to know what they were.  We were told they were similar to lobster, so we gave them a go and so glad we did.  They were scrumptious!  Also ordered the salmon, which was incredible and beautifully prepared!  Hubby's fish n chip was HUGE and he said it was fresh and enjoyed it.  If we are lucky to return to Sydney, we'll be back for sure!!",
            "I was visiting from the US with a friend and our hotel was very close to Blue Fish. On the first night, we walked around trying to find a place to eat after a long day of travel but many of the restaurants were either closing or their menus didn't look good. We saw Blue Fish on yelp and decided to try it despite the 3.5 rating (which should be much higher). The manager, Andrew, was so incredibly welcoming and hospitable. He was engaging and funny the entire night and I really appreciated that. When we arrived, their kitchen was actually closed, but I guess he could see the hunger and weariness in our faces and he asked the kitchen staff if they could accommodate us!   The food is great. So great that we are there three consecutive nights and each night was consistently great food and service. Things to try: seafood paella, 3 Kings linguine, seafood platter for 2, banana split waffle and even the fries!   I would highly recommend Blue Fish and can't wait for my fourth visit!",

Let me start by saying the fried shrimp and fried calamari were probably the best I have had anywhere.  The fried fish was also amazing.  The fries were okay.  The sea scallop was large, but bitter.  I wouldn't suggest it. Overall, it was a very large feast with great seafood."

            "\"An underground prohibition-style bar, celebrating a time when booze was banned, yet free-flowing.\" --Welcome note on their website   Your night at Palmer & Co. begins before you even arrive; walking down Ambercrombie Lane through a nondescript door, and underneath the city streets. From that point on you could be in another place and time. Black and white photographs line the walls and everywhere you look there are details that harken back to yesteryear. P&C's drink focus is on cocktails and spirits, but champagne comes in at a close third, with a wide selection to choose from. To add to the ambiance, they have regular sets of live music, creating a mood of refined debauchery. Who could ask for anything more? (Wellll... never mind.)   Katie and her BFF stuck with a P&C signature drink, aptly named, \"Party Girl With A Bad Habit.\" It's $25 dollars (AUD) a glass, but well, well worth it. Noah (the BFF's FWB) and I kept to the classics: he with the \"Income Tax,\" and me with the \"Bensonhurst.\" Because something needed to absorb all that alcohol, we had multiple sides of steak tartare, black truffle mac and cheese, and marinated olives. Oi!!  Nothing is cheap in Sydney, and that's okay, but if you decide to vacation here, double whatever your budget might currently be. As for Palmer & Co., this is a place to enjoy and indulge. Definitely come visit.",

The drinks are pricey, but similar to NYC cocktail bars. Highly highly recommend checking this place out!!!",

Place is massive and one of the coolest speakeasys I've ever been to. Sad I couldn't pick this place up and take it with me back to Murcia.

            "In Japan you get your yakitori (chicken-on-a-stick) fix in izakayas, informal gastro-pubs where salary men fill in the void between work finishing and dinner. Heading up a \"young but enthusiastic\" team, Tin Jung Shea (ex-The Cliff Dive) has recreated the same super-relaxed drinking atmosphere right here in Crows Nest.  Settle in for beverages and bites at the polished concrete bar with a bird's-eye view of the stick-flipping action, or pull up a table and turn your visit into a casual dinner using clever sides. First on the agenda is washing away the sorrows of your work-life with a palate cleansing ale. The one to drink here is the golden Orion Draft ($8/400ml) from Okinawa - the hip, sub-tropical outpost of Japan. It's crisp, refreshing and mild enough to be a great sake chaser if you're a fan of double-parking.  You know I am, so against a bowl of Edamame ($4.90) and some even better Burdock Root Chips ($4.90) that make a tasty, lightly seasoned alternative to potato chips, I got stuck into sake. The Yurippi team prepared me three tokkuri (flasks) of different sakes and gave me some tips on which dishes they'd suit best. You can get them to do the same, or skip straight to my favourite, the Yuki-no-Bousha ($25/300ml), which has a full, round flavour that makes it a hit with grilled meat.  Start with the classic - Chicken Thigh and Shallot ($2.90/each) accentuated by sweet soy - before you hit the star: Tsukune ($4.50/each). Popular in Japan, these house-made chicken meatballs are made by mincing chicken thighs with soft bones for added texture, shallots, ginger and garlic, basted with sweet soy, and served up with a runny 63-degree egg.  They're also making their own dashi (a Japanese stock) using sake, shitake stems, soy, mirin and kombu, which is put to excellent effect in a delicate, Japanese Omelette ($4.90). The long, brown seaweed (kombu) is also employed in butter form to accentuate sashimi-grade Scallops ($4.50/each). Handle them carefully though, coming straight off the grill, the shells are scorching hot.  At the more fun end of things, there are Bacon-Wrapped Mochi ($4.50) skewers made using glutinous rice cakes. They have a texture similar to roasted marshmallow, without being as sweet. Or there's Japanese fried chook, called Karaage ($4.90), served up here in a mini fry basket with Kewpie mayonnaise.  Now while kombu is the taste I'll most remember this spot for - especially on the super simple Cabbage ($4.90) side - eating my first oden was a very close second. This warming chicken broth is sold in Japanese convenience stores, with the floating additions added like we select lollies in a Pick-n-Mix! You can either let the Yurippi team do the selecting for you by ordering a six-piece Oden Set ($9.90), or choose your own favourites from tofu-wrapped creamy mochi, fishcakes, egg, yam cakes, or wedges of white radish (daikon).  I'd be hard pressed to remember another dish that I've eaten that made me feel more like I was experiencing something authentically Japanese. Yes, authenticity is something this tiny but charming yakitori bar has in abundance!",
            "Authentic yakitori grilled over coals. We really enjoyed our meal. We ordered a selection of the specialities including chicken and spring onion skewers, chicken meatball with poached egg and the grilled onigiri. With 3 adults and 1 toddler we spent $175.",
            "Walking into Yakatori Yurippi was like walking into a side Alley in Roppongi. This is as good as it gets with a wide selection of tasty grilled treats. The Chicken meatball with Egg, Pork Jowl and Pork Belly are some of the many highlights. Many of the options can be served grilled with just salt, or dipped in a sweet soy marinade - delightful  The Okinawa draft beer and excellent Japanese whisky selection rounds off a fantastic experience .... right in the centre of Crows Nest"

Everything from Two Good Eggs Breakfast, to the toast with honey, apples, walnuts, and goat cheese, to their croissant breakfast sandwiches were amazing.  And I have no words for the bacon: way better than American bacon - a good chunk of meat but also crispy ... Yum!  We did try a couple of other places but they did not compare. We ended up coming back here on our last 2 mornings in the city   One thing is they don't have any fresh fruit which my friend was kinda craving. Otherwise, everything was great: food, service, ambiance.  I recommend coming here, even if you're not staying next door - you'll love it!",

The restaurant had a steady flow of traffic while we were there. I had the smoked salmon spinach scrambled eggs, it also comes with two pieces of toasted bread. It was heavenly! My mom ordered the eggs Benedict and mushroom avocado toast. She said it was fabulous! The wait staff were all super friendly. You pay at the counter.

            "We first visited their flagship bar/restaurant - Bar Tapavino which quickly became one of our favourite restaurants. Not long after, they opened another standout - Balcon, which we also greatly loved. This restaurant group have since opened a relatively new addition, situated in Barangaroo, called Born. This restaurant group has a simple recipe for running and it works well -  their drinks have a focus on wine and sherry, sprinkle in some great food, as well as a high standard of service.   We visited Born by Tapavino to round out the trifecta of our visits to the restaurants in the Tapavino range, and we had heard great things about it. This restaurant has a beautiful setting by the water at Barangaroo and with an alfresco dining space as well, it makes for an ideal place to visit for a wine accompanied lunch, afternoon drinks or an evening dining experience.  Drinks wise, at this sort of establishment, we are comfortable to leave it with the staff and you will not be disappointed. The sommeliers do a great job of picking drinks to your preference and matching it with the food you have ordered. Amandine recommended a beautiful red wine which was superb and matched the food incredibly well. One of us was driving on this occasion, and we left it in the bartenders hands to concoct a delicious mocktail.  The tapas (individual bites) had us salivating when trying to decide. We rested on the balmain bug and prawn sliders. The sliders did a good David Copperfield impersenation, they vanished soon after arriving at the table.  The highlight of the tapas experience were some manchego churros are were a revelation. Some soft fried dough topped with the smoked chorizo mayo, so good they should bottle it. Whilst the regular dessert churros have always been good, savoury ones now have our vote. We could have eaten a bucket.   Moving on to primera, these dishes are a larger and great for sharing. We couldn't visit and not try the warm cow's milk cheese wrapped in jamon serrano which is served with truffled honeycomb. This dish is heaven on a plate, if sharing you will do battle for your share.  The mains also great for sharing. The lamb rump was perfectly prepared, sauced with chimichurri to cut through the richness of the meat. This was served with papas fritas tiny fried potato battons, which provided some crunch to the dish and the smoked paprika taking this dish to another level. Paired this with a nice glass of red suggested by the sommelier, Perfecto!  You will need to save room for dessert, as it is a highlight, better yet, just channel the dessert stomach. So many amazing options, the bunuelo (spanish doughnuts) doughnuts must be selected to put a bigger smile on your dial. The dessert special for the evening - a dulche de leche and dark chocolate ganache tart was spectacularly decedent. The chololate and mixed nuts with peanut butter caramel and also the arroz con leche helado, this is a classy Spanish ice cream sandwich and was a clear standout. Make sure this is paired with one of the amazing sherries on offer, the pairing takes this dessert to out of this world good.  Born by Tapavino, is one of our favourite venues for 2017. Great food, drink and service. What else does one need? Nothing.",
            "Tapavino is a go to restaurant for me! The service is always amazing and food is always consistent. I've been to all the Tapavinos in Sydney and each location is always great. It's an awesome location for every event. The wine list is incredibly extensive and the food is designed to be shared. The humble pan con tomate is my staple each visit! You can't go wrong with the jamon, beef cheeks and the shaved cabbage! Highly recommend."

            "My by fave favorite place in Sydney- such a lovely experience. No pictures as they lock your phones away so you can actually visit with each other! Must make a booking/reservation. They grill a steaks right there in the same room- the steaks were delicious. The candle- yes candle, is made out of beef fat and they melt it in front of you!! Bread was delicious, we started with gnocchi. Had Brussel sprouts (so good) and potatoes and of course a bottle of wine!!!!",
            "Just go here! Make sure you have a reservation. Vibe 10 out of 10, food 10 out of 10, service 10 out of 10 and last but not least concept 20 out of 10!!! One of the most unique restaurants I've been to, it's a speakeasy entrance so don't walk by it... watch ling them cook your steak over open fire can't be beat. Must visit with you friends, family or significant other!",
            "can you live without your phone for an hour or 2??? if the answer is NO, go elsewhere!!!  yes, strictly no phones allowed in the dining room! you surrender your phones upon entering their dining room and will only be reunited when you finally pay!  still keen? take a stroll down george street towards the circular quay, like I did. a right onto dalley street will line you up with their nondescript entrance. down some stairs, through another door and you are at the bar. for once, the bar fronts the 'hidden' restaurant! speakeasy the bar isn't but their dining room is obscured from plain sight, behind!  i came without a reservation but managed to secure a counter top seat right by the charcoal fire! once they lock your distracting phones out of the way, the menu, water and wine flowed.  oh red wine on tap? perfect! slightly sparkly, served in a tumbler ala italian style, if you don't mind.  then homemade focaccia welcomes you! served with a side of candle? not any ordinary candle! but an exquisite beef fat candle for you to dip in as it melts!  decision time and bone marrow, bistecca, brussels sprouts, 3Bs ftw! a strange liberating feeling ensued. the duty to take a photo of all the experiences was replaced by the actual experience itself!  bone marrow was perfectly melt in the mouth with a parmesan crust that provided an accentuated texture. the main event however will take some time to craft. there's but one t-bone cut of meat here, just choose how thick and how well done, recommended medium rare. then sitting back watching the professional expertise in action, the master of raw fire, was just such a bliss. simply put the bistecca stood no chance. from the bone chilling sawing, to the branding by cast iron weights against the grills blistered by hot charcoal embers, finishing in and out of a warm oven for that perfect temperature before being carved for easy devouring, orgasmic. masterful teamwork all around, easy to miss if one was constantly on their devices! :) was also awestruck by the brussels sprouts, blackened but not burnt, balanced with the right acidity from balsamico, topped with a gently sharp pecorino and a cooling sour cream finish at the bottom.  so do we really need our phones? a want or a need? sure, this review would probably benefit with some photos of the inner sanctum to prove the talk. but perhaps your engagement would be better for it? the jury is still out........"

            "Crinitis Restaurant, please come to Los Angeles!!!  My daughter and I were visiting family in Sydney over past couple of weeks. One day we went into Darling Harbor and happened upon Crinitis!  We had the most wonderful time there.  The staff, especially RIGZIN, the Assistant Manager, the delicious food that was delivered quickly and hot and did I say delicious, the atmosphere and the views of the harbor.  Lets put it this way, we could think of no other place we would rather go a week later, and the night before we had to fly back to LA, than to go back there for a farewell dinner with my parents.  We made sure to book around 730pm and request the balcony seating, so we could enjoy the Saturday night Darling Harbor fire works show, and again we were treated with smiles and fun by our waitress OLGA and Assistant Manager RIGZIN, came by again to make sure we were  happy and was there anything else he could do to make our experience even better!    Crinitis at Darling Harbor is an epic place to go with a group for fun and also for an romantic dinner for two on the balcony.  I would give it 100 stars if I could!!  Can't wait to head back to Sydney again soon.  First stop - Crinitis!",
            "Perfection! Pure perfection!! Where do I start? Overnight stays in Sydney have become somewhat of a regular occurrence over the past five years; and I always look forward to trying a different restaurant experience. Thanks to this app I have found hidden gems for an amateur foodie from Newcastle that are usually only known by locals. Tonight's choice was to dine at Criniti's Harbourside, Darling Harbour. I chose to dine here tonight based on the extensive menu...so much to choose from; they have something for anyone, any taste or any mood!  I will start with the view...breathtaking!!! I cannot recall seeing Darling Harbour at night, and what a beautiful night it is has been. We arrived and the restaurant inside was packed (as I have learned it is always a good sign of a great meal in Sydney). We were lead by the greeter through the dynamic and electric ambience of the inside seating outside to the million dollar view of Darling Harbour. We were seated and started browsing the menu. I already knew what I was going to get Freshly Shucked Sydney Rock Oysters Kilpatrick style to start and for main, Fettuccine Carbonara (always my staple and safe go-to), while my mother ordered Boscaiola with Gnocchi as recommended by our very welcoming waitress and my father the spaghetti bolognese. Considering the restaurant appeared to be nearing capacity, our starter Oyster Kilpatrick extremely fast!!! The oysters were amazing on their own, but combined with Criniti's Kilpatrick sauce and the bacon are equal first of all time that I have eaten. I found it so difficult to refrain from licking the oyster shell clean of the sauce remaining, I didn't think it would be very appropriate . No sooner than our lovely waitress had cleared our oyster tray and share plates, arrived our mains. The serving size...woah ENORMOUS!!!!! (See pics although I don't think the photos do the serving size justice really). The house made pasta was so beautifully rich, the cured meats in the carbonara and Boscaiola were so flavoursome, and the gnocchi OMG... that gnocchi though, the meatball with the spagbol had such a depth of flavour  I really wanted to get dessert, anything with Nutella as the main ingredient would do, but I was just wholly satisfied with my savoury starter and main, my dessert stomach just isn't functioning tonight.   Thanks to the staff at Criniti's for a wonderful evening!! You deserve so much more than five stars!",
            "OMG!  Everything about this place is amazing.  The service. The menu. The motorbike above the bar. The spirit selection. The cocktails. The wine list. The process of being seated. The food. The prices. The decor. The sheer size of the place. The atmosphere. The cocktail glasses. The pizza. The pasta. The salads.  Everything! Go here, take lots of people order a dish each and share just so you can sample more of the menu.  Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum."

I was immediately seated, and as soon as I put the menu down, someone arrived to ask what I would like. I had a glass of wine and some tapas, which were delivered quite promptly and tasted great. Because I was in a rush, I needed to pay the bill as soon as I finished, and the attentive staff were quick to make that happen. The bill came to roughly $30. I look forward to coming back soon!",
            "The restaurant was conveniently open when we wanted to eat late afternoon where most other kitchens in the area were closed. This was very convenient. Not only that the food and service to come was top notch. I ordered the fillet steak medium rare with creamy potato and mushroom sauce - each element full of flavour and cooked to perfection. My friend ordered the waggu with seasoned vegetables and a red wine jus - the cut of beef was quality! A cider on ice on a sunny afternoon facing the water goes down a treat too. I recommend this place for a nice chilled setting, good menu and reasonably priced too for the area.",
            "Great wine, great food, great service. Cozy, quiet, and romantic. A little exposed to the weather if it's raining, but a great view of the Walsh bay marina and wharf.  We've been there a number of times and will keep going back :-)"

Decided lack of lettuce in my burger even though the PLK image had lettuce in it..not that it detracts from the flavour at all. The smashed beans were smeared on the bun so under the chicken so my bread was falling to pieces - oh well...my hands were messed up already anyway. Also something addictive about the fries! Couldn't stop eating them. Solid. Can't wait to go back and try some other burgers.",
            "IT'S BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK!!!!!  For those familiar with Bill and Tony's Pub Life Kitchen a few years ago in Surry Hills which then had a popup in Flinder's and then another one out west...they finally have a solid location, this time in Ultimo.  Known for their burgers, they also have daily specials as well on top of $10 lunches.  All burgers come with fries and beware as the O.G. comes medium rare.  The O.G. ($18) - house ground beef, caramelised onions, tomato, lettuce, smoked cheese, homemade aioli  The Cheeseburger ($17) - house ground beef, cheese x2, pickles, onion, mustard, homemade tomato sauce  The Bird ($18) - dorito fried chicken, jack cheese, slaw, mayo  They also have some new additions like sticky hot wangs ($9).  So glad this is back",
            "I'll start this off simply - come here for the burgers. PLK is a cosy little nook tucked in the back of the Lord Worsley (here's some trivia, it's apparently the narrowest pub in NSW). Get in early or anticipate a wait for a table.  The burgers are next level here, simple no fuss fare cooked incredibly well. The cheeseburger ($17) is larger than you expect once you lay into it, no complaints here! A juicy beef patty cooked a perfect medium, with two slices of jack cheese, pickles and the most dope ketchup/mustard combo given the warmest of hugs between a delectable milk bun. Drool city. Burgers are served with fries, ask for some gravy to really up the ante.  Service was great, not too stuffy and really helpful. If you love a great burger (a la Mary's and Mister Gee's) then you absolutely need to try this joint."

The seafood is always super fresh and I love the laid back vibe and nautical/ sea decor. We went overboard and got the seafood platter which is suggested for two but can safely feed 3/4. The prices (in my view) are still relatively reasonable for the quality of the food. We popped a bottle of Bollinger and had quite a fare! This little nook of the world is beautiful and such a pure little treasure that it always makes even a drab day turn into something special. As long as the Boat House is still there, the  pilgrimages will continue. Love love love it",
